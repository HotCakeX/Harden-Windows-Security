* **Browse**: Use this button to browse for App Control XML policy files that you want to Sign and deploy.

* **Deploy**: Use this button to deploy all of the XML files you selected on the local or cloud system.

* **Sign Only - No Deployment**: If you only want to sign the policy without deploying it, you can use this button. It will generate the signed CIP file for you that you can use to manually deploy somewhere else.

<br>

When signing and deploying App Control Policies, a dialog will be displayed asking for additional information required for signing the policy.

* **Certificate File**: Provide the path to the certificate `.cer` file. It must be a code signing certificate that is either issued by a public certificate authority (CA) or a self-signed certificate. You can generate a self-signed certificate suitable for App Control policy signing in [the certificate building page](https://github.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/wiki/Build-New-Certificate) of the AppControl Manager. The certificate's details will be added to the XML policy as signers. The certificate must exist in the Personal store of the Current User certificate stores with private key.

* **Certificate Common Name**: The Common Name (CN) of the same certificate file you select.

Once you've provided all 3 items, press the **Verify** button. It will verify your inputs and then the **Submit** button will be enabled, allowing you to proceed with policy signing and deployment.

All of the information you submit will be saved in app settings so that the next time they will be automatically populated for you.
