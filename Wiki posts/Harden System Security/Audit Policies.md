Use this page in the [Harden System Security App](https://github.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/wiki/Harden-System-Security) to retrieve every audit policy on the system — currently numbering **approximately 540** items — far more comprehensive than what some other tools report. You can search, sort, and modify each policy's state individually.
