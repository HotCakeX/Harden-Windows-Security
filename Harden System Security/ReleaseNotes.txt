* Added a new dropdown button to the Sidebar, responsible for enabling or disabling Nested Virtualization for all Hyper-V virtual machines on the system.

* The Sidebar's pane is now resizable and no longer has a fixed width.

* Improved localizations.

It is particularly beneficial for high-performance computing tasks, gaming, and other resource-intensive applications.
