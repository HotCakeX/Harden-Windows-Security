# Update

In the [AppControl Manager's](https://github.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/wiki/AppControl-Manager) update page you can configure the app to automatically check for updates at startup. Alternatively, you can manually check for updates or customize the update behavior to use a hardened update procedure for enhanced security.

Additionally, you can select an MSIX package to install as an update for AppControl Manager. This feature is particularly useful if you've already downloaded the MSIX file from GitHub or built the application from the source code yourself.
