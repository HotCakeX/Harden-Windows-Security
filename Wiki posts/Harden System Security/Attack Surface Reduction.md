* Launching executable files and scripts that attempt to download or run files
* Running obfuscated or otherwise suspicious scripts
* Performing behaviors that apps don't usually initiate during normal day-to-day work

Such software behaviors are sometimes seen in legitimate applications. However, these behaviors are often considered risky because they are commonly abused by attackers through malware. Attack surface reduction rules can constrain software-based risky behaviors and help keep your organization safe.

[Reducing your attack surface](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/attack-surface-reduction) means protecting your devices and network, which leaves attackers with fewer ways to perform attacks. Configuring attack surface reduction rules in Windows can help!
