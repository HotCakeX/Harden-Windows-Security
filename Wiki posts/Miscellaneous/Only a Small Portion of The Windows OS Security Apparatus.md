### Windows Defender Firewall (Rule Based)

Windows Firewall is a **Stateful Firewall**. It is a security feature that helps to protect your device by filtering network traffic that enters and exits your device. This traffic can be filtered based on several criteria, including source and destination IP address, IP protocol, or source and destination port number.

* [Read More](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/operating-system-security/network-security/windows-firewall/)

<br>

### Automated Firewall With AppID Tagging

Windows Firewall supports the use of Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) Application ID (AppID) tags. With this capability, you'll be able to scope your firewall rules to an application or a group of applications and rely on WDAC policies to define those applications. The WDAC AppID functionality adds an administrator defined tag to the given process token.

For example, you can easily use a policy that allows only files that come with Windows by default to be allowed to access the Internet while everything else will be blocked.

<br>

### Startup Key (USB Flash Drive)

Requires a USB flash drive to be inserted into the computer to start the computer. The USB flash drive must contain the startup key for the encrypted drive. **This key is only a portion of the complete key required to perform a successful authentication. The other portion of of the key is provided by the Startup PIN.**

<br>

### Secure Boot (PCR7 Binding)

Secure Boot blocks untrusted firmware and bootloaders (signed or unsigned) from being able to start on the system. By default, BitLocker provides integrity protection for Secure Boot by utilizing the TPM PCR 7 measurement. An unauthorized EFI firmware, EFI boot application, or bootloader can't run and acquire the BitLocker key.

* [Read More](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/operating-system-security/data-protection/bitlocker/countermeasures#protection-before-startup)

<br>

### TPM

A TPM is a microchip designed to provide basic security-related functions, primarily involving encryption keys. The TPM is installed on the motherboard of a computer, and it communicates with the rest of the system by using a hardware bus.

* [Read More](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/hardware-security/tpm/tpm-fundamentals)

<br>

### Startup PIN

In addition to the protection that the TPM provides, part of the encryption key is stored on a USB flash drive, and a PIN is required to authenticate the user to the TPM. This configuration provides multifactor authentication so that if the USB key is lost or stolen, it can't be used for access to the drive, because the PIN is also required. Preboot authentication with a PIN can mitigate an attack vector for devices that use a bootable eDrive because an exposed eDrive bus can allow an attacker to capture the BitLocker encryption key during startup.

<br>

## Firmware Security

### System Management Mode (SMM) Protection

SMM code executes in the highest privilege level and is invisible to the OS. SMM protection is built on top of the Secure Launch technology and requires it to function. A hardware-enforced processor feature known as a supervisor SMI handler can monitor the SMM and make sure it doesn't access any part of the address space that it isn't supposed to. Windows measures SMI Handler's behavior and attest that no OS-owned memory has been tampered with.

### Static Root of Trust for Measurement (SRTM)

It is a hardware-based root of trust that helps ensure no unauthorized firmware or software (such as a bootkit) can start before the Windows bootloader. This hardware-based root of trust comes from the device's Secure Boot feature, which is part of the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI). This technique of measuring the static early boot UEFI components is called the Static Root of Trust for Measurement (SRTM).

### Personal Data Encryption (PDE)

PDE utilizes Windows Hello for Business to link data encryption keys with user credentials. When a user signs in to a device using Windows Hello for Business, decryption keys are released, and encrypted data is accessible to the user.
When a user logs off, decryption keys are discarded and data is inaccessible, even if another user signs into the device.

* [Read More](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/operating-system-security/data-protection/personal-data-encryption/)

<br>

### Enhanced Sign-in Security (ESS)

Windows Hello enables a user to authenticate using their biometrics or a PIN eliminating the need for a password. Biometric authentication uses facial recognition or fingerprint to prove a user's identity in a way that is secure, personal, and convenient. Enhanced Sign-in Security provides an additional level of security to biometric data by leveraging specialized hardware and software components, such as Virtualization Based Security (VBS) and Trusted Platform Module 2.0 to isolate and protect a user's authentication data and secure the channel by which that data is communicated.

* [Read More](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/windows-hello-enhanced-sign-in-security)

<br>

### Credential Guard

Credential Guard prevents credential theft attacks by protecting NTLM password hashes, Kerberos Ticket Granting Tickets (TGTs), and credentials stored by applications as domain credentials.

Credential Guard uses Virtualization-based security (VBS) to isolate secrets so that only privileged system software can access them. Unauthorized access to these secrets can lead to credential theft attacks like pass the hash and pass the ticket.

* [Read More](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/credential-guard/)

<br>

### Admin-less

Most people run as full admins on their devices, which means apps and services have the same access to the kernel and other critical services as users. And the problem is that these apps and services can access critical resources without the user knowing. This is why Windows requires just in time administrative access to the kernel and other critical services as needed, not all the time, and certainly not by default. This makes it harder for an app to unexpectedly abuse admin privileges and secretly put malware or malicious code on Windows. When this feature is enabled, such as when an app needs special permissions like admin rights, you'll be asked for approval.

<br>

### Windows Hello Multi-Factor Authentication

Windows Hello for Business supports the use of a single credential (PIN and biometrics) for unlocking a device. Therefore, if any of those credentials are compromised (shoulder surfed), an attacker could gain access to the system.

Windows Hello for Business can be configured with multi-factor unlock, by extending Windows Hello with trusted signals. Administrators can configure devices to request a combination of factors and trusted signals to unlock them.
