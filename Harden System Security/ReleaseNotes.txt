✅ Added a new security measure to the Microsoft Defender category that will force Microsoft Defender to run in a sandbox for enhanced protection against tampering.

✅ Window Appearance Customization

Introduced a customization option in Settings to personalize the app window with colors selected from an integrated palette.

Added an optional animated rainbow mode that smoothly cycles through the full color spectrum.

Designed for high performance with an extremely minimal resource footprint.

✅ New Home Page

Debuted a new Home page that opens by default on app startup, engineered for speed and efficiency.

Features refined visuals and purposeful animations that remain lightweight and responsive.

Provides concise system HUDs at a glance:
✔️ Current time
✔️ Time zone
✔️ Total RAM
✔️ Total disk capacity
✔️ System uptime
✔️ App memory usage (total RAM used by the app)
✔️ Internet speed (upload and download shown separately)
✔️ Includes a modern spotlight section to quickly browse rotating news and content.
✔️ Very subtle cyber web mesh background that periodically lights up at different coordinates.

More enhancement will be applied to the Home page in future updates. Feel free to share your feedback on GitHub with me.
