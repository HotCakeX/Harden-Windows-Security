🐉 Enhanced the Intune cloud deployment workflow with a dedicated page that lets you enumerate all Microsoft 365 and Intune groups in your tenant and select which group(s) to assign to the App Control policy you are deploying. The page includes search, sorting, and filtering capabilities to help you pinpoint target groups, and you can export the results to JSON for offline analysis.

🍭 You can now add or remove groups in your tenant's Entra directly from the app, no need to visit the Entra portal. This functionality is available on the newly added Entra group assignment and management page.

💪 Improved resilience of Microsoft Graph connections to better handle transient network issues and unstable connections.

📏 Implemented more aggressive memory cleanup when the app window closes, enabling faster and more predictable reclamation of used memory.

🍬 Refined the styling and behavior of content dialogs across the app. Resizing no longer produces a semi-transparent shadow artifact.

🍫 Implemented a token refresh mechanism for Microsoft Graph. Sign in once and continue using AppControl Manager for extended periods without re-authentication. Silent refresh events are logged for auditing; for privacy and security only the account name/email associated with the refreshed token is recorded. Automatic refresh is initiated when a token has less than 10 minutes remaining before expiration.
