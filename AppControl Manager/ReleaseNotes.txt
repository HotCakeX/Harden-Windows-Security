* Fixed a bug where certain properties in Intune policies could not be parsed properly when reading them from the incoming data in the System Information page and would lead to an error displayed in the UI.

* Improved localizations for several languages.

* Improved the message texts that appear in the UI during various operations to make them clearer. This also improves the logs generated by the app in the Logs page.

* Updated dependencies to the latest version.

* Completed the following GitHub feature request: https://github.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/issues/901 by implementing a toggle switch to the page that controls whether the unsupported/undocumented rule options are enabled or disabled. The default is disabled.

* Added a new option to the Settings page called "Code Integrity Management V2". When enabled (off by default), AppControl Manager performs all policy deployment and removal operations directly, without relying on CiTool.exe. Use this when CiTool.exe is blocked or unavailable.
