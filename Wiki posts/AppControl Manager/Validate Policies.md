Use this [AppControl Manager](https://github.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/wiki/AppControl-Manager) page to validate AppControl Manager XML files against the official schema that is located in `C:\Windows\schemas\CodeIntegrity\cipolicy.xsd`.

If you manually modified some parts of an App Control policy, this is a great way to ensure your modifications are valid. If the policy is not valid, you will see an error message that will help you understand what is wrong with the policy so you can fix it.
