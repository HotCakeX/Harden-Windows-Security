    .SYNOPSIS
        Make sure the latest version of the module is installed and if not, automatically update it, clean up any old versions
    .PARAMETER InvocationStatement
        The command that was used to invoke the main function/cmdlet that invoked the Update-self function, this is used to re-run the command after the module has been updated.
        It checks to make sure the Update-self function was called by an authorized command, that is one of the main cmdlets of the Harden-Windows-Security module, otherwise it will throw an error.
        The parameter also shouldn't contain any backtick or semicolon characters used to chain commands together.
