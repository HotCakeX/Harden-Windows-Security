The Protect page in the [Harden System Security App](https://github.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/wiki/Harden-System-Security) is a central hub for Apply, Verifying or Removing the security measures. It offers presets with optimal pre-selected categories and sub-categories to streamline the hardening process.

Each Security Measure category in this page has its own dedicated page where you can view and modify the specific settings related to that category in a more detailed manner. When you use the Apply, Verify or Remove buttons in this page, it is as if you are directly interacting with the button on that category's page.
