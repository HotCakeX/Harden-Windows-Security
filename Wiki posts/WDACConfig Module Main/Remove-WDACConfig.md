## Remove-WDACConfig -UnsignedOrSupplemental

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HotCakeX/.github/main/Pictures/Wiki%20APNGs/Remove-WDACConfig/Remove-WDACConfig%20-UnsignedOrSupplemental.apng)

## Syntax

```powershell
Remove-WDACConfig
    [-UnsignedOrSupplemental]
    [-PolicyNames <String[]>]
    [-PolicyIDs <String[]>]
    [-Force]
    [-Confirm]
    [<CommonParameters>]
```

## Description

Removes Unsigned deployed App Control policies as well as [Signed deployed Supplemental App Control policies](https://github.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/wiki/WDAC-Notes#removing-supplemental-policies)

> [!NOTE]\
>  When using `-PolicyNames` parameter, if multiple policies with the exact same name are deployed, when you press TAB, you will only see 1 of them, if you select it, all of the policies with that name will be removed. If that's not desired, consider using `-PolicyIDs` parameter instead.

> [!NOTE]\
> The auto-completion in these 2 parameters are smart. E.g., if there are 10 policies deployed on the system, you can press Tab to select 5 of them by IDs, but when you try to select the other 5 by their names, the name of the policies that you already selected by IDs don't show up anymore. This greatly reduces user error and simplifies the workflow for end user.

## Parameters

### -PolicyIDs

The submitted values are verified against the currently deployed policies and if they match, the policies are removed.

Just press TAB key and it will autofill the values for you based on the deployed policies. If you want to select multiple names, after each one, enter a comma `,` and then press TAB again to choose another name.
