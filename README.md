![GreenCheckCircleMark] __Harden-Windows-Security is a PowerShell script. It automates all of the tasks required to harden Windows Security beyond the default state. It is suitable and recommended to be run on every home computer.__ See the <a href="#features">Features</a> section below.

![GreenCheckCircleMark] __For Enterprises, Highly-Secure Servers and Data Centers, Highly-Secure Workstations and such, [__Use Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) resources on this repository.__](https://github.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/wiki/Introduction)__

<h1> <br> </h1>
</br>

> __Warning__  Windows by default is secure and safe, this script does not imply nor claim otherwise. just like anything, you have to use it wisely and don't compromise yourself with reckless behavior and bad user configuration; Nothing is foolproof. This script only uses the tools and features that have already been implemented by Microsoft in Windows OS to fine-tune it towards the highest security and locked-down state, using well-documented, supported, recommended and official methods. continue reading for comprehensive info.

> __Note__ Make sure your hardware (Tablet, Laptop, PC, Phone) meets the [Windows 11 hardware requirements](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/windows-11-specifications?r=1) __AND__ [Virtualization Based Security requirements](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/oem-vbs). Currently, Windows 11 allows some older than 8th Gen Intel CPUs (or their AMD equivalents), such as Intel i7 7700K, to use [insider builds](https://insider.windows.com/) only. You will miss a lot of new features, benefits and new security technologies that are only available on newer hardware. You need to enable TPM 2.0, Virtualization technology and Secure Boot in your UEFI if they aren't enabled by default (which is the case on older hardware). To Enable Secure Boot in your UEFI firmware settings [Check out this official guide](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-11-and-secure-boot-a8ff1202-c0d9-42f5-940f-843abef64fad) - How to enable Secure Boot on: [HP](https://support.hp.com/document/ish_4300937-4295746-16?openCLC=true) - [Lenovo](https://support.lenovo.com/solutions/ht509044) - [Dell](https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/000190116/How-to-Enable-Secure-Boot-on-Your-Dell-Device)

## Features:<a href="#features">![FeaturesIcon]</a>

- Always stays up-to-date with the newest security features and only guaranteed to work on the latest version of Windows, **which is currently Windows 11**. (_rigorously tested on the latest Stable and Insider preview builds_).
  
- The script is in [plain text](https://github.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/blob/main/Harden-Windows-Security.ps1), nothing hidden, no 3rd party executable or pre-compiled binary is involved.
  - <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/main/images/red-alert.gif" width="25" alt="Important notice"> **For your own security**, do not use any other 3rd party tools, programs or scripts that claim to harden Windows or modify it in any way, **unless you can 100% verify it**. [Never trust 3rd party people on the Internet,](https://hotcakex.github.io/PDFViewer#5-Risk-Points-to-Avoid-in-Enterprise-Security) always verify their resources and do that after each release. **Keep on reading the features to see why this Harden-Windows-Security script is different and <a href="#Trust">read the Trust section</a> to see how you can 100% Trust it.**

- The script doesn't remove or disable Windows functionalities against Microsoft's recommendation.
  
- All of the links and sources are official from Microsoft websites, straight from the source. No bias, No misinformation and definitely No old obsolete methods. That's why there are no links to 3rd party news websites, forums, made up blogs/articles and such.

- The script primarily uses Group policies, **the Microsoft recommended way of configuring Windows**. It also uses PowerShell cmdlets where Group Policies aren't available, and finally uses [a few registry keys](https://github.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/blob/main/Payload/Registry.csv) to configure security measures that can neither be configured using Group Policies nor PowerShell cmdlets. This is why the script doesn't break anything or cause unwanted behavior.
  - <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/main/images/red-alert.gif" width="25" alt="Important notice"> **Any other 3rd party tool/program/script that claims to modify Windows or harden it, if they don't strictly adhere to the official rules above, they can damage your system, cause unknown problems and bugs.** [How are Group Policies for this script created and maintained?](https://github.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/wiki/Group-Policy#how-are-group-policies-for-this-script-created-and-maintained)

- This Readme page is used as the reference for all of the security measures applied by this script and Group Policies.

- When a hardening measure is no longer necessary because it's applied by default by Microsoft on new builds of Windows, it will also be removed from this script in order to prevent any problems and because it won't be necessary anymore.

- The script can be run infinite number of times, it's made in a way that it won't make any duplicate changes at all.

- The script asks for confirmation, in the PowerShell console, before running each hardening category and some sub-categories, so you can selectively run (or don't run) each of them.

- Applying this script makes your PC compliant with Microsoft Security Baselines and Secured-core PC specifications (providing that you use modern hardware that supports the latest Windows security features) - [See what makes a Secured-core PC](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/oem-highly-secure#what-makes-a-secured-core-pc) - <a href="#Device-Guard">Check Device Guard category for more details.</a>
  - [Secured-core](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/oem-highly-secure) â€“ recommended for the most sensitive systems and industries like financial, healthcare, and government agencies. Builds on the previous layers and leverages advanced processor capabilities to provide protection from firmware attacks.
  
- There are 4 items tagged with __#TopSecurity__ that can cause some inconvenience. When you run this script, you will have an option to enable them if you want to. Press `Control + F` and search for `#TopSecurity` on this page to find those security measures.

- Since I originally created this repository for myself and people I care about, I always maintain it to the highest possible standard.

## Microsoft Defender<a href="#Microsoft-Defender">![WindowsDefenderIcon]</a>

- ðŸŸ© Enables __additional__ security features of Microsoft Defender, You can refer to [this official document](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/defender/set-mppreference?view=windowsserver2022-ps) for full details.

  - [Performance analyzer for Microsoft Defender Antivirus](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/tune-performance-defender-antivirus)

- ðŸŸ© This script makes sure [Cloud Security Scan](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/what-is-a-cloud-security-scan-75112696-7660-4450-9194-d717f72a8ad8) and [Block At First Sight](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/configure-block-at-first-sight-microsoft-defender-antivirus?view=o365-worldwide#turn-on-block-at-first-sight-with-group-policy) are enabled to the highest possible security states available, __Zero Tolerance Cloud Block level__. You need to be aware that this means actions like downloading and opening an unknown file __will__ make Microsoft Defender send samples of it to the Cloud for more advanced analysis and it can take a maximum of 60 seconds (this script sets it to max) from the time you try to open that unknown file to the time when it will be opened (if deemed safe), so you will have to wait. All of these security measures are in place by default in Windows to some extent and happen automatically without the need to run this script, but this script __maxes them out and sets them to the highest possible levels__ at the cost of ðŸ”»convenience and usability.ðŸ”ºIt's always a trade-off.

  - Here is an example of the notification you will see in Windows 11 if that happens.
  
  <p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/main/Windows%20Security%20Cloud%20Analysis.png" alt="Windows Security Cloud Scan Notification" width="200"></p>
  
- ðŸŸ© Enables file hash computation; [designed](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/defender/set-mppreference?view=windowsserver2022-ps#-enablefilehashcomputation) to allow admins to force the anti-malware solution to "compute file hashes for every executable file that is scanned if it wasn't previously computed" to "improve blocking for custom indicators in Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Microsoft Defender ATP).

- ðŸŸ© Clears Quarantined items after 5 days instead of the default behavior of keeping them indefinitely.

- ðŸŸ© Lets Microsoft Defender use up to 60% of the CPU instead of the default 50%, during scans.

- ðŸŸ© Allows Microsoft Defender to download security updates even on a metered connection.

- ðŸŸ© Enables Microsoft Defender to scan network drives, restore points, Emails and removable drives during a full scan, so it will take a while to finish a full scan if you have lots of those Items.

- ðŸŸ© Sets the Signature Update Interval to every 3 hours instead of automatically.
  - [Change logs for security intelligence updates](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/definitions/antimalware-definition-release-notes)
  - [Configure and validate Microsoft Defender Antivirus network connections](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/configure-network-connections-microsoft-defender-antivirus?view=o365-worldwide)
  - [Security intelligence updates for Microsoft Defender Antivirus and other Microsoft antimalware](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/defenderupdates)
  - [Microsoft Safety Scanner](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/intelligence/safety-scanner-download?view=o365-worldwide)

- ðŸŸ© Forces Microsoft Defender to check for new virus and spyware definitions before it runs a scan.

- ðŸŸ© Makes Microsoft Defender run [catch-up scans](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/defender/set-mppreference?view=windowsserver2022-ps#-disablecatchupquickscan) for scheduled quick scans. A computer can miss a scheduled scan, usually because the computer is off at the scheduled time, but now after the computer misses two scheduled quick scans, Microsoft Defender runs a catch-up scan the next time someone logs onto the computer.

- ðŸŸ© Enables [Network Protection of Microsoft Defender](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/network-protection?view=o365-worldwide) (Requires Windows Pro or Enterprise editions)

- ðŸ”¶ Makes sure [Async Inspection for Network protection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/network-protection?view=o365-worldwide#optimizing-network-protection-performance) of Microsoft Defender is turned on - Network protection now has a performance optimization that allows Block mode to start asynchronously inspecting long connections after they're validated and allowed by SmartScreen, which might provide a potential reduction in the cost that inspection has on bandwidth and can also help with app compatibility problems.

- ðŸ”¶ __(Requires additional confirmation to run):__ Enables [Smart App Control:](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/what-is-smart-app-control-285ea03d-fa88-4d56-882e-6698afdb7003) adds significant protection from new and emerging threats by blocking apps that are malicious or untrusted. Smart App Control also helps to block potentially unwanted apps, which are apps that may cause your device to run slowly, display unexpected ads, offer extra software you didn't want, or do other things you don't expect.
  - Smart App Control is User-Mode (and enforces Kernel-Mode) [Windows Defender Application Control policy (WDAC)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/windows-defender-application-control-design-guide), __more info__ [__in the Wiki__](https://github.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/wiki/Introduction). You can see its status in [`System Information`](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/view-your-system-info-a965a8f2-0773-1d65-472a-1e747c9ebe00) and enable it manually from Microsoft Defender app's GUI. It is very important for Windows and Windows Defender intelligence updates to be always up-to-date in order for Smart App Control to work properly as it relies on live intelligence and definition data from the cloud and other sources to make a Smart decision about programs and files it encounters.
  - Smart App Control uses [ISG (Intelligent Security Graph)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/use-windows-defender-application-control-with-intelligent-security-graph#how-does-wdac-work-with-the-isg). The ISG isn't a "list" of apps. Rather, it uses the same vast security intelligence and machine learning analytics that power Microsoft Defender SmartScreen and Microsoft Defender Antivirus to help classify applications as having "known good", "known bad", or "unknown" reputation. This cloud-based AI is based on trillions of signals collected from Windows endpoints and other data sources and processed every 24 hours. As a result, the decision from the cloud can change.
  - [Smart App Control](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/windows-defender-application-control#wdac-and-smart-app-control) can block a program entirely from running or only [some parts of it](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/smart-app-control-has-blocked-part-of-this-app-0729fff1-48bf-4b25-aa97-632fe55ccca2) in which case your app or program will continue working just fine most of the time. It's improved a lot since it was introduced, and it continues doing so. Consider turning it on after clean installing a new OS and fully updating it.

    - _Note: [At this time Smart App Control is only recommended in the North American and European regions](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/what-is-smart-app-control-285ea03d-fa88-4d56-882e-6698afdb7003)._
  - Smart App Control enforces the [Microsoft Recommended Driver Block rules](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/microsoft-recommended-driver-block-rules) and the [Microsoft Recommended Block Rules](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/microsoft-recommended-block-rules)
  
  - Once you turn Smart App Control off, it can't be turned on without resetting or reinstalling Windows.

- ðŸŸ© Enables [Controlled Folder Access](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/enable-controlled-folders). It [helps protect your valuable data](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/controlled-folders) from malicious apps and threats, such as ransomware. Controlled folder access protects your data by checking apps against a list of known, trusted apps. Due to the recent wave of global ransomware attacks, it is important to use this feature to protect your valuables files, specially OneDrive folders.
  - If it blocks a program from accessing one of your folders it protects, and you absolutely trust that program, then you can add it to exclusion list using Microsoft Defender GUI or PowerShell. you can also query the list of allowed apps using PowerShell (commands below). with these commands, you can backup your personalized list of allowed apps, that are relevant to your system, and restore them in case you clean install your Windows.

```PowerShell
# Add multiple programs to the exclusion list of Controlled Folder Access
Set-MpPreference -ControlledFolderAccessAllowedApplications 'C:\Program Files\App\app.exe','C:\Program Files\App2\app2.exe'
```

```PowerShell
# Get the list of all allowed apps
$(get-MpPreference).ControlledFolderAccessAllowedApplications
```

<br>

- ðŸ”¶ Enables [Mandatory ASLR,](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/enable-exploit-protection?view=o365-worldwide) ðŸ”»It might cause compatibility issuesðŸ”º only for some poorly-made 3rd party programs, specially portable ones.
  - You can add Mandatory ASLR override for a trusted program using the PowerShell command below or in the Program Settings section of Exploit Protection in Microsoft Defender app.
    - `Set-ProcessMitigation -Name "C:\TrustedApp.exe" -Disable ForceRelocateImages`
  - [There are more options for Exploit Protection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/enable-exploit-protection?view=o365-worldwide) but enabling them requires extensive reviewing by users because mixing them up can cause a lot of compatibility issues.

- ðŸŸ© Check for the latest virus and spyware security intelligence on startup.
- ðŸŸ© Specifies the maximum depth to scan archive files to the maximum possible value of `4,294,967,295`
- ðŸŸ© [Defines the maximum size of downloaded files and attachments to be scanned](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/configure-advanced-scan-types-microsoft-defender-antivirus?view=o365-worldwide) and set it to the maximum possible value of `10,000,000 KB` or `10 GB`. [the default is](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/microsoft-365-docs/pull/5600) `20480 KB` or `~20MB`
- ðŸŸ© Enforces all features of the [Enhanced Phishing Protection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-smartscreen/phishing-protection-microsoft-defender-smartscreen?tabs=gpo) in Microsoft Defender SmartScreen.

- ðŸ”¶ __(Requires additional confirmation to run):__ [Create scheduled task for fast weekly Microsoft recommended driver block list update.](https://github.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/wiki/Fast-and-Automatic-Microsoft-Recommended-Driver-Block-Rules-updates)

- ðŸ”¶ __(Requires additional confirmation to run):__ Set Microsoft [Defender engine](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/defender/set-mppreference#-engineupdateschannel) and [platform update channel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/defender/set-mppreference#-platformupdateschannel) to beta.

## Attack surface reduction rules<a href="#Attack-surface-reduction-rules">![ASRrulesIcon]</a>

ðŸŸ© [Reducing your attack surface](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/attack-surface-reduction) means protecting your devices and network, which leaves attackers with fewer ways to perform attacks. Configuring attack surface reduction rules in Windows can help!

ðŸŸ© [Attack surface reduction rules](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/attack-surface-reduction-rules-reference?view=o365-worldwide) target certain software behaviors, such as:

* Launching executable files and scripts that attempt to download or run files
* Running obfuscated or otherwise suspicious scripts
* Performing behaviors that apps don't usually initiate during normal day-to-day work

Such software behaviors are sometimes seen in legitimate applications. However, these behaviors are often considered risky because they are commonly abused by attackers through malware. Attack surface reduction rules can constrain software-based risky behaviors and help keep your organization safe.

ðŸŸ© This script enables [all 16 available Attack Surface Reduction rules shown in the official chart](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/attack-surface-reduction-rules-reference?view=o365-worldwide#asr-rule-to-guid-matrix).

## Bitlocker Settings<a href="#Bitlocker-Settings">![BitlockerIcon]</a>

- ðŸ”¶ðŸŸ© This script sets up and configures Bitlocker, for OS drive and all other non-removable drives on the device [using official documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/information-protection/bitlocker/bitlocker-group-policy-settings), with the most secure configuration and Military Grade encryption algorithm, __XTS-AES-256, TPM 2.0 and start-up PIN__, to protect the confidentiality and integrity of all information at rest and in use.

  - You will be asked to enter a Startup PIN when activating Bitlocker for the first time. Make sure it contains at least 10 characters (uppercase and lowercase letters, symbols, numbers, spaces) and it's not the same as your Windows Hello PIN.

  - Once you run this script for the first time, there will be a text file containing the 48-digit recovery password for each encrypted drive that will be saved in itself, with the names like `Drive C recovery password.txt`. It is ðŸ”»very important to keep it in a safe and reachable place, e.g., in OneDrive's Personal Vault which requires authentication to access. See [Here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/onedrive/personal-vault) and [Here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/protect-your-onedrive-files-in-personal-vault-6540ef37-e9bf-4121-a773-56f98dce78c4) for more info about OneDrive's Personal VaultðŸ”º

  - TPM has [special anti-hammering logic](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/information-protection/tpm/tpm-fundamentals) which prevents malicious user from guessing the authorization data indefinitely. [Microsoft defines that maximum number of failed attempts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/dubaisec/tpm-lockout) in Windows is 32 and every single failed attempt is forgotten after 2 hours. This means that every continuous two hours of powered on (and successfully booted) operation without an event which increases the counter will cause the counter to decrease by 1. You can view all the details using this [PowerShell command](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/trustedplatformmodule/get-tpm): `Get-TPM`.

  - Check out <a href="#Lock-Screen">Lock Screen</a> category for more info about the recovery password and the 2nd anti-hammering mechanism.

  - To have even more security than what the script provides, you can utilize a [Startup key in addition to the other 3 key protectors](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/information-protection/bitlocker/bitlocker-countermeasures#pre-boot-authentication) (TPM, Startup PIN and Recovery password). with this method, part of the encryption key is stored on a USB flash drive, and a PIN is required to authenticate the user to the TPM. This configuration __provides multifactor authentication__ so that if the USB key is lost or stolen, it can't be used for access to the drive, because the correct PIN is also required.

  - BitLocker will bring you a real security against the theft of your device if you strictly abide by the following basic rules:
    - As soon as you have finished working, either Hibernate or shut Windows down and allow for every shadow of information to disappear from RAM within 2 minutes. __ðŸ”ºthis practice is recommended in High-Risk Environments.ðŸ”»__

    - Do not mix 3rd party encryption software and tools with Bitlocker. Bitlocker creates a secure end-to-end encrypted ecosystem for your device and its peripherals, this secure ecosystem is backed by things such as software, Virtualization Technology, TPM 2.0 and UEFI firmware, Bitlocker protects your data and entire device against __real-life attacks and threats__. You can encrypt your external SSDs and flash drives with Bitlocker too.

- ðŸŸ© Enables or disables [DMA protection from Bitlocker Countermeasures](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/information-protection/bitlocker/bitlocker-countermeasures#protecting-thunderbolt-and-other-dma-ports) based [on the status](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/windows-itpro-docs/issues/6878#issuecomment-742429128) of [Kernel DMA protection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/information-protection/kernel-dma-protection-for-thunderbolt). Kernel DMA Protection is [not compatible](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/information-protection/kernel-dma-protection-for-thunderbolt#system-compatibility) with other BitLocker DMA attacks countermeasures. It is recommended to disable the BitLocker DMA attacks countermeasures if the system supports Kernel DMA Protection (this script does that exactly). Kernel DMA Protection provides higher security bar for the system over the BitLocker DMA attack countermeasures, while maintaining usability of external peripherals. you can check the status of Kernel DMA protection [using this official guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/information-protection/kernel-dma-protection-for-thunderbolt#how-to-check-if-kernel-dma-protection-is-enabled).
  - [Kernel DMA Protection (Memory Access Protection) for OEMs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/oem-kernel-dma-protection) page shows the requirements for Kernel DMA Protection. for Intel CPUs, support for requirements such as VT-X and VT-D can be found in each CPU's respective product page. e.g. [Intel i7 13700K](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/230500/intel-core-i713700k-processor-30m-cache-up-to-5-40-ghz.html)

## TLS Security<a href="#TLS-Security">![TLSIcon]</a>

ðŸ”¶ This script disables TLS 1 and TLS 1.1 security protocols that only __exist for backward compatibility__. All modern software should and do use `TLS 1.2` and `TLS 1.3`.

Changes made by the script only affect things that use [Schannel SSP](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthn/protocols-in-tls-ssl--schannel-ssp-): that includes Edge, IIS web server, built-in inbox Windows apps and some other programs supplied by Microsoft, but not 3rd party software that use [portable stacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_TLS_implementations#Portability_concerns) like Java, nodejs, python or php.

If you want to read more: [Demystifying Schannel](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/core-infrastructure-and-security/demystifying-schannel/ba-p/259233)

- ðŸ”¶ Enables `TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256` cipher Suite which is [available but not enabled](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthn/tls-cipher-suites-in-windows-11) by default in Windows 11, and sets its priority to highest.

- ðŸ”¶ Enables the following secure Diffie-Hellman based key exchange algorithms which are available in Windows 11 but not enabled by default, [according to this Microsoft Document](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthn/tls-cipher-suites-in-windows-11): `"TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA"`,`"TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA"`,`"TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256"`

- ðŸ”¶ Disables `NULL` ciphers that are __only available for backward compatibility__:`"TLS_RSA_WITH_NULL_SHA256"`,`"TLS_RSA_WITH_NULL_SHA"`,`"TLS_PSK_WITH_NULL_SHA384"`,`"TLS_PSK_WITH_NULL_SHA256"`

## Lock Screen<a href="#Lock-Screen">![LockScreenIcon]</a>

- ðŸŸ© [Automatically locks device after X seconds of inactivity](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/interactive-logon-machine-inactivity-limit) (just like mobile phones), which is set to 120 seconds (2 minutes) in this script, you can change that to any value you like.

- ðŸŸ© [Requires `CTRL+ALT+DEL` on the lock screen](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/interactive-logon-do-not-require-ctrl-alt-del), the reason and logic behind it is:

  - A malicious user might install malware that looks like the standard sign-in dialog box for the Windows operating system and capture a user's password. The attacker can then sign into the compromised account with whatever level of user rights that user has.

- ðŸŸ© Enables [a security anti-hammering feature](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/interactive-logon-machine-account-lockout-threshold) that sets a threshold of 6 for the number of failed sign-in attempts that causes the device to be locked by using BitLocker. Sign-in attempts include Windows password or Windows Hello authentication methods. This threshold means, if the specified maximum number of failed sign-in attempts is exceeded, the device will invalidate the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) protector and any other protector except the 48-digit recovery password, and then reboot. During Device Lockout mode, the computer or device only boots into the touch-enabled Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE) until an authorized user enters the recovery password to restore full access.
  - This script (<a href="#Bitlocker-Settings">in the Bitlocker category</a>) automatically saves the 48-digit recovery password of each drive in itself, the location of it will also be visible on the PowerShell console when you run it. It is ðŸ”»very important to keep it in a safe and reachable place, e.g. in OneDrive's Personal Vault which requires authentication to access. See [Here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/onedrive/personal-vault) and [Here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/protect-your-onedrive-files-in-personal-vault-6540ef37-e9bf-4121-a773-56f98dce78c4) for more info about OneDrive's Personal VaultðŸ”º

- ðŸŸ© [Hides email address of the Microsoft account on lock screen](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/interactive-logon-display-user-information-when-the-session-is-locked), if your device is in a trusted place like at home then this isn't necessary.

- ðŸŸ© [Don't display username at sign-in](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/interactive-logon-dont-display-username-at-sign-in); If a user signs in as Other user, the full name of the user isn't displayed during sign-in. In the same context, if users type their email address and password at the sign-in screen and press Enter, the displayed text "Other user" remains unchanged, and is no longer replaced by the user's first and last name, as in previous versions of Windows 10. Additionally, if users enter their domain user name and password and click Submit, their full name isn't shown until the Start screen displays.
  - [Useful](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/interactive-logon-dont-display-username-at-sign-in#best-practices) If you have devices that store sensitive data, with monitors displayed in unsecured locations, or if you have devices with sensitive data that are remotely accessed, revealing logged on user's full names or domain account names

- ðŸŸ© ðŸ”»#TopSecurityðŸ”º[Don't display last signed-in](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/interactive-logon-do-not-display-last-user-name); This security policy setting determines whether the name of the last user to sign in to the device is displayed on the Secure Desktop. If this policy is enabled, the full name of the last user to successfully sign in isn't displayed on the Secure Desktop, nor is the user's sign-in tile displayed. Additionally, if the Switch user feature is used, the full name and sign-in tile aren't displayed. The sign-in screen requests a qualified domain account name (or local user name) and password.
  - This feature can be useful to enable if you live in ðŸ”»High-Risk EnvironmentsðŸ”º and you don't want anyone to get any information about your device when it's locked and you're not around.

- ðŸŸ© [Don't Display Network Selection UI on Lock Screen](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-windowslogon#dontdisplaynetworkselectionui) (like WIFI Icon); This setting allows you to control whether anyone can interact with available networks UI on the logon screen. Once enabled, the device's network connectivity state cannot be changed without signing into Windows. Suitable forðŸ”»High-Risk EnvironmentsðŸ”º

## User Account Control<a href="#User-Account-Control">![UACIcon]</a>

- ðŸŸ© [Prompt for elevation of privilege on secure desktop for all binaries](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/user-account-control/user-account-control-group-policy-and-registry-key-settings#user-account-control-behavior-of-the-elevation-prompt-for-administrators-in-admin-approval-mode) in [Administrator accounts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-gpsb/341747f5-6b5d-4d30-85fc-fa1cc04038d4), which presents the sign-in UI and restricts functionality and access to the system until the sign-in requirements are satisfied. The [secure desktop's](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/user-account-control-switch-to-the-secure-desktop-when-prompting-for-elevation#reference) primary difference from the user desktop is that only trusted processes running as SYSTEM are allowed to run here (that is, nothing is running at the user's privilege level). The path to get to the secure desktop from the user desktop must also be trusted through the entire chain.
  - __This is the default behavior:__ prompt the administrator in Admin Approval Mode to select either "Permit" or "Deny" for an operation that requires elevation of privilege for any non-Windows binaries. If the Consent Admin selects Permit, the operation will continue with the highest available privilege. This operation will happen on the secure desktop
  - __This is the behavior that this script sets:__ prompts the administrator in Admin Approval Mode to select either "Permit" or "Deny" an operation that requires elevation of privilege. If the Consent Admin selects Permit, the operation will continue with the highest available privilege. "Prompt for consent" removes the inconvenience of requiring that users enter their name and password to perform a privileged task. This operation occurs on the secure desktop.

- ðŸŸ© ðŸ”»#TopSecurityðŸ”ºOnly elevate executables that are signed and validated [by enforcing cryptographic signatures on any interactive application](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/user-account-control-only-elevate-executables-that-are-signed-and-validated) that requests elevation of privilege. One of the [Potential impacts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/user-account-control-only-elevate-executables-that-are-signed-and-validated#potential-impact) of it is that it can prevent certain poorly designed programs from prompting for UAC.

- ðŸŸ© Changes the [behavior of the elevation prompt for standard users](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/user-account-control/user-account-control-group-policy-and-registry-key-settings#user-account-control-behavior-of-the-elevation-prompt-for-standard-users) from "prompt for credentials" to "prompt for credentials on the secure desktop".
  - ðŸ”»#TopSecurityðŸ”º behavior: Automatically deny all UAC prompts on Standard accounts. __Highly recommended to be used on sensitive critical machines.__ Only use Standard account for regular everyday tasks, and if you want to perform administrative tasks such as intalling a program system-wide or changing system settings, completely log out of the Standard account and log into an Administrator account, perform the tasks, then completely log out and log back into the Standard account to continue your work.

## Miscellaneous Configurations<a href="#Miscellaneous-Configurations">![MiscellaneousIcon]</a>

- ðŸŸ© Sets [Early launch antimalware](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/install/elam-driver-requirements) engine's status to `8` which is __Good only.__ The default value is `3`, which allows good, unknown and 'bad but critical'. that is the default value, because setting it to `8` [can prevent your computer from booting](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/early-launch-antimalware#mitigation) if the driver it relies on is critical but at the same time unknown or bad.

  - By being launched first by the kernel, ELAM is ensured to be launched before any third-party software and is therefore able to detect malware in the boot process and prevent it from initializing. ELAM drivers must be specially signed by Microsoft to ensure they are started by the Windows kernel early in the boot process.

- ðŸŸ© Disables location service system wide. Websites and apps won't be able to use your precise location, however they will still be able to detect your location using your IP address.

- ðŸŸ© Enables [`svchost.exe` mitigations.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-servicecontrolmanager) built-in system services hosted in `svchost.exe` processes will have stricter security policies enabled on them. These stricter security policies include a policy requiring all binaries loaded in these processes to be signed by Microsoft, and a policy disallowing dynamically generated code.
  - Requires Business (e.g. [Windows 11 pro for Workstations](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/business/windows-11-pro-workstations)), [Enterprise](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/windows/windows-11-enterprise) or [Education](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/education/products/windows) Windows licenses

- ðŸ”¶ Turns on Enhanced mode search for Windows indexer. the default is classic mode.
  - this causes some UI elements in the search settings in Windows settings to become unavailable for Standard user accounts to view, because it will be a managed feature by an Administrator.

- ðŸŸ© [Enforce the Administrator role for adding printer drivers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/devices-prevent-users-from-installing-printer-drivers)

- ðŸŸ© Enables [SMB/LDAP Signing](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/storage-at-microsoft/configure-smb-signing-with-confidence/ba-p/2418102)
- ðŸ”¶ Enables [SMB Encryption](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/storage/file-server/smb-security). Its status can be checked using the following PowerShell command: `(get-SmbServerConfiguration).EncryptData`. If the returned value is `$True` then SMB Encryption is turned on.

- ðŸ”¶ Enables Edge browser (stable/beta/dev channels) to download and install updates on any network, metered or not; because the updates are important and should not be suppressed.

- ðŸ”¶ [Enables all Windows users to use Hyper-V and Windows Sandbox](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/virtual_pc_guy/why-do-you-have-to-elevate-powershell-to-use-hyper-v-cmdlets) by adding all Windows users to the "Hyper-V Administrators" security group. By default, only Administrators can use Hyper-V or Windows Sandbox.

- ðŸ”¶ Changes Windows time sync interval from the default every 7 days to every 4 days (= every 345600 seconds)

- ðŸ”¶ Creates custom views for [Windows Event Viewer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/shows/inside/event-viewer) to help keep tabs on important security events: `Attack Surface Reduction Rules`, `Controlled Folder Access`, `Exploit Protection`, `Network Protection`, `MSI and Scripts for WDAC Auditing`, `Sudden Shut down events` (due to power outage) and `Code Integrity Operational`.

## Certificate Checking Commands<a href="#Certificate-Checking-Commands">![CertificateIcon]</a>

ðŸ”¶ In this category, the script downloads and runs [sigcheck64.exe](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sigcheck) from [Sysinternals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/), then lists valid certificates not rooted to the [Microsoft Certificate Trust List](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/seccrypto/certificate-trust-list-overview) in the [User and Machine certificate stores](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/install/local-machine-and-current-user-certificate-stores). __Except for some possible Microsoft certificates, Windows insider builds certificates or certificates that have your own computer's name, which are perfectly safe and should not be deleted,__ All other certificates that will be listed should be treated as dangerous and removed from your system immediately.

<p align="right"><a href="#menu-back-to-top">ðŸ’¡(back to categories)</a></p>

## Country IP Blocking<a href="#Country-IP-Blocking">![CountryIPBlockingIcon]</a>

ðŸ”¶ The script uses the newest range of `IPv4` and `IPv6` addresses of [State Sponsors of Terrorism](https://www.state.gov/state-sponsors-of-terrorism/) and [OFAC Sanctioned Countries](https://orpa.princeton.edu/export-controls/sanctioned-countries), directly [from official IANA sources](https://github.com/HotCakeX/Official-IANA-IP-blocks), then creates 2 rules (inbound and outbound) for each list in Windows firewall, completely blocking connections to and from those countries.

Once you have those Firewall rules added, you can [use this method](https://github.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/wiki/Event-Viewer#how-to-identify-which-windows-firewall-rule-is-responsible-for-a-blocked-packets) to see if any of the blocked connections were from/to those countries.

## Non-Admin Commands<a href="#non-admin-commands">![NonAdminIcon]</a>

You don't need admin privileges to run this category, because no system-wide changes is made. changes in this category only apply to the current user account that is running the PowerShell session. For this reason, in addition to running this category as admin on your own user account, it's better to run it without elevation on any other available standard accounts too.

- ðŸ”¶ Shows known file extensions in File explorer
- ðŸ”¶ Shows hidden files, folders and drives (toggles the control panel folder options item)
- ðŸ”¶ Disables websites accessing local language list - good for privacy
- ðŸ”¶ Turns off safe search in Windows search, will enable +18 content to appear in searches; essentially toggles the button in: Windows settings > privacy and security > search permissions > safe search

## Trust<a href="#trust">![TrustIcon]</a>

### How can you 100% trust this repository and know that nothing shady is going on?

This repository uses the simplest possible, yet effective, methods that make it very easy to verify:

- Change log history is present on GitHub. _(Despite some of my awkward documentation typos)_

- You can open the file in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)/[Visual Studio Code Web](https://vscode.dev/), and view the script in a nice easy to read environment, it's well formatted and indented.

- You can fork this repository, verify it until that point in time, then verify any subsequent changes/updates I push to this repository, __at your own pace__ (using `Sync fork` and `Compare` options on your fork), and if you are happy with the changes, allow it to be merged with your own copy/fork on your GitHub account.
- You can learn PowerShell which is super easy, multiplatform, and useful for the future, Microsoft Learn website teaches you everything, then you will understand everything in the script is safe, or you can ask someone that you trust and knows PowerShell to verify the script for you.

- The [Payload folder](https://github.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/tree/main/Payload) in this repository contains the files required to run this script:
  - [Registry.csv](https://github.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/blob/main/Payload/Registry.csv) includes registry data used by this script, viewable in plain text and easily verifiable.
  
  - [EventViewerCustomViews.zip](https://github.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/blob/main/Payload/EventViewerCustomViews.zip) includes XML files, in plain text, easily readable and verifiable. the script downloads and copies them to `C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Event Viewer\Views` so that when you open [Windows Event Viewer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/host-integration-server/core/windows-event-viewer1), you will find custom views as explained in the <a href="#Miscellaneous-Configurations">Miscellaneous Configurations</a> category.
  
  - [Security-Baselines-X.zip](https://github.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/blob/main/Payload/Security-Baselines-X.zip) includes Group Policies that are used by this script to apply the security measures explained in this page.

## Security Recommendations<a href="#security-recommendations">![SecurityRecommendationIcon]</a>

* Always download your operation system from [official Microsoft websites](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download). Right now, Windows 11 is the latest version of Windows, its ISO file can be downloaded from this [official Microsoft server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows11). One of the worst things you can do to your own security and privacy is downloading your OS, which is the root of all the active and passive security measures, from a 3rd party website claiming they have the official unmodified files. There are countless bad things that can happen as the result of it such as threat actors embedding malware or backdoors inside the customized OS, or pre-installing customized root CA certificates in your OS so that they can perform TLS termination and view all of your HTTPS and encrypted Internet data in plain clear text, __even if you use VPN.__ Having a poisoned and compromised certificate store is the endgame for you, and _that's just the tip of the iceberg._
  - Refer to [Wiki](https://github.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/wiki) to see [how to create Bootable USB flash drive with no 3rd party tools](https://github.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/wiki/Create-Bootable-USB-flash-drive-with-no-3rd-party-tools)

* Whenever you want to install a program or app, first use the [Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/apps) or <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli">Winget</a>, if the program or app you are looking for isn't available in there, then download it from its official website. _Somebody created a nice web interface for interacting with Winget CLI <a href="https://winstall.app/">here</a>._ Using Winget or Microsoft store provides many benefits:
  - Microsoft store UWP apps are secure in nature, digitally signed, in [MSIX format](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/msix/overview). That means, installing and uninstalling them is guaranteed and there won't be any leftovers after uninstalling.
  - Microsoft store has Win32 apps too, they are traditional `.exe` installers that we are all familiar with. The store has a library feature that makes it easy to find the apps you previously installed.
  - Both Microsoft and Winget check the hash of the files by default, if a program or file is tampered, they will warn you and block the installation, whereas when you manually download a program from a website, you will have to manually verify the file hash with the hash shown on the website, if any.

* Use Secure DNS; Windows 11 natively supports <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/networking/dns/doh-client-support">DNS over HTTPS</a> and <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/networking-blog/dns-over-tls-available-to-windows-insiders/ba-p/3565859">DNS over TLS</a>.
  - I've created a PowerShell module to use a __DNS over HTTPS server that doesn't have a stable IP address__, on Windows 11, [feel free to check it out](https://github.com/HotCakeX/Set-DynamicIPDoHServer).

* Only use Microsoft Edge for browser; It has [the Highest-rated protection against phishing and malware](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/deployedge/ms-edge-security-for-business#highest-rated-protection-against-phishing-and-malware), available by default on Windows OS, has tightly integrated valuable Security features such as <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-application-guard/md-app-guard-overview">Microsoft Defender Application Guard</a>, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-smartscreen/microsoft-defender-smartscreen-overview">Microsoft Defender SmartScreen</a>, <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/enhance-your-security-on-the-web-with-microsoft-edge-b8199f13-b21b-4a08-a806-daed31a1929d">Hardware Enforced Stack Protection</a>, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/exploit-protection-reference?view=o365-worldwide#arbitrary-code-guard">Arbitrary Code Guard (ACG)<a/>, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/exploit-protection-reference?view=o365-worldwide#control-flow-guard-cfg">Control Flow Guard (CFG)</a>, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/web-platform/tracking-prevention">Tracking Prevention</a> and <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/use-the-microsoft-edge-secure-network-to-protect-your-browsing-885472e2-7847-4d89-befb-c80d3dda6318">Trusted built-in Secure Network feature from Cloudflare</a> just to name a few.

* [Always enable Two-Factor/Multi-Factor Authentication](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/the-keys-to-the-kingdom-securing-your-devices-and-accounts-a925f8ad-af7e-40d8-9ce4-60ea1cac2ba4) on websites, apps and services that you use. Preferably, use [Microsoft Authenticator app](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/account-billing/download-and-install-the-microsoft-authenticator-app-351498fc-850a-45da-b7b6-27e523b8702a) which has backup and restore feature, so you never lose access to your TOTPs (Time-Based One-Time Passwords) even if you lose your phone. Available for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.azure.authenticator&gl=US">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-authenticator/id983156458">IOS</a>. You can also use Microsoft Authenticator on Windows 11 (PC, Laptop or Tablet) using <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windows-subsystem-for-android%E2%84%A2-with-amazon-appstore/9P3395VX91NR?hl=en-us&gl=us">Windows Subsystem for Android (WSA)</a> and access your authenticator codes without the need to use your phone (secure automatic backup/restore feature). Use an open and trusted Android store such as <a href="https://auroraoss.com/">Aurora Store</a> to <a href="https://github.com/whyorean/AuroraStore">install</a> and keep it up to date.

* Make sure OneDrive backup for important folders (Desktop/Documents/Pictures) is enabled. It is fast, secure and works in any network condition and since it's [x64 (64-bit)](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-onedrive-blog/onedrive-sync-64-bit-for-windows-now-in-public-preview/ba-p/2260619), it can handle a Lot of small and large files simultaneously.

* If you live in a western country, NATO country, European country or Australia, do not use VPNs. __your local ISP (Internet service provider) is a lot more trustworthy than the remote VPN server's ISP.__ Using VPN __only__ takes the trust from your own local ISP and puts it in the hands of the remote ISP that the VPN server uses for its Internet, Nothing else. period. Do not fall for the fake advertisements of VPN companies, you never know who is behind the VPN provider, what their political views are, their background, where their allegiance lies. The permissive civilized western world could allow a state sponsor of terrorism or some other hostile country to create a VPN company in here and gather intelligence and collect bulk data for mining, tracking etc. this has happened before and one of [the most recent](https://www.techradar.com/news/iran-officials-linked-to-canada-based-free-vpn-provider) revelations is about a [VPN provider called Betternet, based in Canada](https://archive.ph/xOVeY), ran by [IRGC terrorists and their families abroad](https://twitter.com/lisa_loo_who/status/1567984903312257025). Stay vigilant and smart.
  - There are situations where using VPN can provide security and privacy. For example, when using a public WiFi hotspot or basically any network that you don't have control over. In such cases, use [Cloudflare WARP](https://cloudflarewarp.com/), _or as mentioned, use Secure Network in Edge browser that utilizes the same secure Cloudflare network_. It's free, [uses WireGuard protocol](https://developers.cloudflare.com/warp-client/get-started/windows), it's from an American company that [has global radar](https://radar.cloudflare.com/) and lots of insight about countries in the world in real-time, [at least 19.7% of all websites use it (2022)](https://blog.cloudflare.com/application-security/). Safe to say it's one of the __backbones of the Internet.__

* [Go passwordless](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/account-billing/how-to-go-passwordless-with-your-microsoft-account-674ce301-3574-4387-a93d-916751764c43) with your [Microsoft account](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2021/09/15/the-passwordless-future-is-here-for-your-microsoft-account/) and use [Windows Hello authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/hello-for-business/hello-why-pin-is-better-than-password). In your Microsoft account which has Outlook service, [you can create up to 10 Email aliases](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/add-or-remove-an-email-alias-in-outlook-com-459b1989-356d-40fa-a689-8f285b13f1f2) in addition to the 1 Email address you get when you made your Microsoft account, that means without creating a new account, you can have 11 Email addresses all of which will use the same inbox and account. You can specify which one of those Email aliases can be used to sign into your account, [in the sign in preferences of your Microsoft account settings](https://account.live.com/names/manage). So for example, when going passwordless, if you need you can give one of your Email aliases to others for communication or add it to a public profile of yours, then block sign in using that Email alias so nobody can send you authenticator notifications by entering that Email alias in the sign in page, and use the other 10 aliases that are private to sign into your Microsoft account with peace of mind. You can [create a rule in your Outlook](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/inbox-rules-in-outlook-web-app-edea3d17-00c9-434b-b9b7-26ee8d9f5622) so that all of the Emails sent to your public Email alias will be stored in a different folder, apart from your other inbox emails. All of this can be done using free Microsoft account and [Outlook webapp](https://outlook.live.com/).

* Set a strong password for the UEFI firmware of your device so that it will ask for password before allowing any changes to be made to firmware. You can also configure the password to be required on startup.

* Use __NTFS__ (which is the default Filesystem in Windows) or __ReFS__ (Resilient File System, newer). In addition to all their benefits, they support `Mark Of The Web` (MOTW) or `zone.identifier`. When a file is downloaded to a device running Windows, Mark of the Web is added to the file, identifying its source as being from the internet. [You can read all the information about it in here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/deployoffice/security/internet-macros-blocked#mark-of-the-web-and-trusted-documents). If your USB flash drive is formatted as `FAT32`, change it to `NTFS`, because `FAT32` does not keep the `MOTW` of the files. If the file you are downloading is compressed in `.zip` format, make sure you open/extract it using Windows built-in support for `.zip` files because it keeps the MOTW of the files. If the compressed file you downloaded is in other formats such as `.7zip` or `.rar`, make sure you use an archive program that supports keeping the mark of the Web of files after extraction. One of those programs is NanaZip which is a fork of 7zip, available in [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9N8G7TSCL18R) and [GitHub](https://github.com/M2Team/NanaZip), compared to 7zip, it has better and modern GUI, and the application is [digitally signed](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/trusted-root/program-requirements). After installation, open it, navigate to `Tools` at the top then select `Options`, set `Propagate zone.id stream` to `Yes`. You can use this [PowerShell command](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/get-content?view=powershell-7.3#-stream) to find all the info about the Zone Identifier of the files you downloaded from the Internet.

```PowerShell
Get-Content <Path-To-File> -stream zone.identifier
```

* When using Xbox, make sure you [configure sign-in preference](https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/account-profile/signin-security/change-signin-preferences) and set it to either `Ask for my PIN` or `Lock it down`. The latter is the most secure one since it will require authentication using Microsoft Authenticator app. `Ask for my PIN` is recommended for the most people because it will only require a PIN to be entered using controller.

* A few reminders about open source programs:
  - Unless you are a skilled programmer who can understand and verify every line of code in the source, and spends time to personally build the software from the source, and repeats all the aforementioned tasks for each subsequent version, then seeing the source code won't have any effect on you because you aren't able to understand nor verify it.
  
  - **The majority of "open source" programs are unsigned,** meaning they don't have a digital signature, their developers haven't bought and used a code signing certificate to sign their program. Among other problems, this poses a danger to the end-users, makes it harder to create trust for those programs in security solutions and makes it hard to authenticate them. [Read Microsoft's Introduction to Code Signing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/internet-explorer/ie-developer/platform-apis/ms537361(v=vs.85)) or [Digicert's 5 reasons why Code Signing is necessary.](https://www.websecurity.digicert.com/security-topics/why-use-code-signing)
  
  - [When using "open source" program,](https://www.youtube.com/clip/Ugkxa5lOPIfLs67tGP0QzWRHOfqf3CSRaa2S) there is not the kind of liability that you've got when you consume software from a commercial entity that is obligated and knows their reputation is at risk/stake, that they have potential legal liability if there are vulnerabilities in their software. In the open-source world, there is a volunteer, consume it as is, and if there is a problem with the software, that's your responsibility.
