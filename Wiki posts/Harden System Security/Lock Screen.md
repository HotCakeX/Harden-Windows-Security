    - A malicious user might install malware that looks like the standard sign-in dialog box for the Windows operating system and capture a user's password. The attacker can then sign into the compromised account with whatever level of user rights that user has.

- <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/main/images/Gifs/bluemark.gif" width="25" alt="Blue Check mark denoting Group Policy"> Enables [a security anti-hammering feature](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/interactive-logon-machine-account-lockout-threshold) that sets a threshold of **5** for the number of failed sign-in attempts that causes the device to be locked by using BitLocker. Sign-in attempts include Windows password or Windows Hello authentication methods. This threshold means, if the specified maximum number of failed sign-in attempts is exceeded, the device will invalidate the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) protector and any other protector except the 48-digit recovery password, and then reboot. During Device Lockout mode, the computer or device only boots into the touch-enabled Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE) until an authorized user enters the recovery password to restore full access.

    - [The Harden System Security App](https://github.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/wiki/Harden-System-Security) automatically saves the 48-digit recovery password of each drive in itself, the location of it will also be visible on the PowerShell console when you run it. It is **very important to keep it in a safe and reachable place, e.g. in OneDrive's Personal Vault which requires authentication to access. See [Here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/onedrive/personal-vault) and [Here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/protect-your-onedrive-files-in-personal-vault-6540ef37-e9bf-4121-a773-56f98dce78c4) for more info about OneDrive's Personal Vault**

In the same context, if users type their email address and password at the sign-in screen and press Enter, the displayed text "Other user" remains unchanged, and is no longer replaced by the user's first and last name, as in previous versions of Windows 10. Additionally, if users enter their domain user name and password and click Submit, their full name isn't shown until the Start screen displays. <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HotCakeX/.github/main/Pictures/Gifs/green-verification.gif" width="15" alt="Rotating green checkmark denoting CSP"> [CSP](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-localpoliciessecurityoptions#interactivelogon_donotdisplayusernameatsignin)

    - [Useful](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/interactive-logon-dont-display-username-at-sign-in#best-practices) If you have devices that store sensitive data, with monitors displayed in unsecured locations, or if you have devices with sensitive data that are remotely accessed, revealing logged on user's full names or domain account names

If this policy is enabled, the full name of the last user to successfully sign in isn't displayed on the Secure Desktop, nor is the user's sign-in tile displayed. Additionally, if the Switch user feature is used, the full name and sign-in tile aren't displayed.

    - This feature can be useful to enable if you live in *High-Risk Environments* and you don't want anyone to get any information about your accounts when you aren't logged-in.

    - This policy will prevent you from using "Forgot my PIN" feature in lock screen or logon screen. If you forget your PIN, you won't be able to recover it.

    - If you use Windows Hello Face or Fingerprint, you can easily login using those credential providers without the need to supply username first.

- <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/main/images/Gifs/bluemark.gif" width="25" alt="Blue Check mark denoting Group Policy"> Applies the following [PIN Complexity rules](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/security/identity-protection/hello-for-business/hello-manage-in-organization#pin-complexity) to Windows Hello <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HotCakeX/.github/main/Pictures/Gifs/green-verification.gif" width="15" alt="Rotating green checkmark denoting CSP"> [CSP](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/client-management/mdm/passportforwork-csp#devicetenantidpoliciespincomplexity). Please note that, by default, any character can be set as a PIN. However, the following policies ensure that certain characters are always included as a minimum requirement.

    - [Must include digits](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/client-management/mdm/passportforwork-csp#usertenantidpoliciespincomplexitydigits) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HotCakeX/.github/main/Pictures/Gifs/green-verification.gif" width="15" alt="Rotating green checkmark denoting CSP"> [CSP](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/client-management/mdm/passportforwork-csp#devicetenantidpoliciespincomplexitydigits)

    - [Expires](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/client-management/mdm/passportforwork-csp#usertenantidpoliciespincomplexityexpiration) **every 180 days** (default behavior is to never expire) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HotCakeX/.github/main/Pictures/Gifs/green-verification.gif" width="15" alt="Rotating green checkmark denoting CSP"> [CSP](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/client-management/mdm/passportforwork-csp#devicetenantidpoliciespincomplexityexpiration)

      - Setting an expiration date ensures that, in the event of theft, a threat actor cannot indefinitely attempt to guess the PIN. After 180 days, the PIN expires, rendering it unusable even if guessed correctly. To reset the PIN, authentication via a Microsoft account or EntraID—likely inaccessible to the attacker—will be required. Combined with anti-hammering and BitLocker policies, this expiration guarantees that a threat actor cannot endlessly persist in guessing the PIN.

    - [History](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/client-management/mdm/passportforwork-csp#usertenantidpoliciespincomplexityhistory) of the **1** most recent selected PIN is preserved to prevent the user from reusing it <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HotCakeX/.github/main/Pictures/Gifs/green-verification.gif" width="15" alt="Rotating green checkmark denoting CSP"> [CSP](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/client-management/mdm/passportforwork-csp#devicetenantidpoliciespincomplexityhistory)
