A security baseline is a group of Microsoft-recommended configuration settings that explains their security implications. These settings are based on feedback from Microsoft security engineering teams, product groups, partners, and customers.

In this page, the Harden System Security app enables you to apply the Microsoft Security Baselines on your system, verify compliance, and remove the applied policies.

You can measure the compliance level of your system using the built-in compliance assessment functionality by simply pressing the **Verify** button on this page. You will receive a detailed report of every security measure inside the Microsoft Security Baseline and you will be able to export this security report to a properly formatted JSON file as well.

Each security measure has the following details:

1. `Friendly Name`: Helps you easily identify the security measure and its purpose.
2. `Source`: Shows you which part of the Microsoft Security Baseline this security measure belongs to.
3. `Status`: Whether the current system applies the security measure or not.
4. `Current Value`: The current value of the security measure on the system.
5. `Expected Value`: The correct and secure value the security measure should be in order to be compliant.
