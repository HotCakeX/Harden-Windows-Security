ü©µ Improved the visual design for the app's Protect page.

ü©µ Optional Windows Features improvements:

   ‚ù§Ô∏è ListView stays scrollable while background activities run.

   ‚ù§Ô∏è Verify / Apply / Remove buttons disable during other activities; the button that started the activity remains enabled so you can cancel it.

   ‚ù§Ô∏è ListView split into Recommended (the wiki-documented features/capabilities the app manages) and Others.

   ‚ù§Ô∏è DISM component is now compatible with Arbitrary Code Guard (ACG) and many DISM operations (especially listing features/capabilities) are faster.

   ‚ù§Ô∏è New Retrieve Recommended Only button returns only the features the app verifies/applies/removes (much faster than Retrieve All).

   ‚ù§Ô∏è The ListView now displays feature descriptions (and recommended capability descriptions) for easier understanding.

   ‚ù§Ô∏è Removing optional features now also deletes the feature payload from disk to free space (reinstall requires download from Windows Update).

ü©µ Microsoft Defender ‚Äî Exclusion: New unified Exclusion section that aggregates File/Folder, Process, Extension, Controlled Folder Access, and Attack Surface Reduction rules (ASR) exclusions. You can retrieve, filter, sort, search, add, and remove exclusions ‚Äî added in response to a community feature request.
