You can scale the security policies you trust locally to your entire fleet of Windows devices. The Harden System Security app introduces an Intune dashboard, allowing you to bridge the gap between local hardening and cloud management.

* Unified Policy Control: Instantly view your existing Device Configuration policies or push the hardened standards directly to the cloud.

* Complete Group Management: Effortlessly search, sort, add, remove, and export Entra groups without leaving the app.

* Streamlined Assignments: Deploy new policies and assign them to the right security groups in a single workflow.
