Full System Report Generation 🎊

Harden System Security now supports comprehensive system reports you can save to a file. Every security category participates, including Microsoft Security baselines and Microsoft 365 apps security baselines. The header records device name, user account, and time. Reports include a security score, per-category item counts, and total compliant vs. non-compliant items.

Back Up and Restore 🪅

After generating a report (full or single category), you can import and apply it on any system with the app. Two modes:

Partial: only items marked Applied in the report are applied.
Full: the system is synchronized to the report: measures marked Applied are applied; those marked Not Applied are removed. You can back up selected categories or the entire system state to JSON and deploy to many workstations. Fully automatable via the new CLI.

Unified Search 🎉

The top bar is now a unified, localized search with contextual results across all categories and pages. Type a few letters (for example, "Administrator Protection") without knowing the category; accurate suggestions appear with page icons. Works in your app language (for example, German or Polish).
