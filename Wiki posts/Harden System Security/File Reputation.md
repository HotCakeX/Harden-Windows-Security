# File Reputation | Harden System Security

In this page of the [Harden System Security](https://github.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/wiki/Harden-System-Security), you're able to query any file on the system to retrieve its reputation information. The source of this data is [Microsoft's Intelligent Security Graph](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/security/application-security/application-control/app-control-for-business/design/use-appcontrol-with-intelligent-security-graph) when the [Smart App Control](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/apps/develop/smart-app-control/overview) is enabled or in Evaluation Mode, otherwise it will be the [SmartScreen](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/security/operating-system-security/virus-and-threat-protection/microsoft-defender-smartscreen/) who supplies the reputation data for this feature.
