<br>

App Control which is built deep inside of the OS kernel doesn‚Äôt need any ‚Äúagents‚Äù to be installed, that means it can‚Äôt be killed using techniques used against 3rd party solutions, it also doesn‚Äôt increase the attack surface of the system. It‚Äôs native and exceedingly fast which makes it transparent to the user.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HotCakeX/.github/main/Pictures/WDAC%20FAQ/What%20Is%20ISG%20And%20How%20Can%20I%20Use%20It%20In%20An%20Application%20Control%20(WDAC)%20Policy.png" alt="What Is ISG And How Can I Use It In An App Control Policy">

<br>

ISG stands for [The Intelligent Security Graph](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/application-security/application-control/app-control-for-business/design/use-appcontrol-with-intelligent-security-graph). It's a very powerful AI-based system that processes Trillions of signals from all kinds of data sources every day. You can utilize it as the arbiter in App Control policies so it can help you allow trusted apps and block unknown or malicious apps automatically.
