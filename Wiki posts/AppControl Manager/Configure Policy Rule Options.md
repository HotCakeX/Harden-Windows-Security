Use this page in [AppControl Manager](https://github.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/wiki/AppControl-Manager) to configure the rule options in an App Control policy. You can find all of the available rule options and their descriptions in [this Microsoft Learn page](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/application-security/application-control/app-control-for-business/design/select-types-of-rules-to-create#table-1-app-control-for-business-policy---policy-rule-options).

Additionally, this page offers policy templates. These are pre-configured set of rule options suitable for each use case. Use the drop down menu to select one and apply it to an XML policy file.

## Configuration Details

* **Apply The Changes**: Press this button to apply the changes you made to the policy rule options.

* **Retrieve Rules States**: **By default, when you select an XML policy file, the checkboxes representing the rule options will be checked or unchecked according to the rule options in that file.** If you want to retrieve the rule options from the XML policy file again, maybe after modifying it manually, press this button.
