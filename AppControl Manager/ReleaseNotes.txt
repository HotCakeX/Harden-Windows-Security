* Updated dependencies to the latest version.

* Added new options under the "Actions" button in Event Logs policy creation page that offers the ability to clear the entire system logs for Code Integrity and App Locker categories.

* Made various performance improvements across the board.

* Added a delete option to the selected files/folders previews across the app so that in addition to "clear all" button, you can remove the files or folders you've selected individually and easily.
