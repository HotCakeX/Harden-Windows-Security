The Group Policy Editor page enables you to retrieve the effective policies on the system. You can sort and search through this data via the available UI controls. You can also browse for `.POL` group policy files on your system or a shared network location in order to inspect it.

Since the [Harden System Security app](https://github.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/wiki/Harden-System-Security) can be set as the default handler of the `.POL` files, this page is also displayed when you double-click or tap on any `.POL` file in the File Explorer.

You may remove any policy from a `.POL` file â€” whether a system `.POL` or one you opened in the app. All edits are correctly persisted back to the selected `.POL` file.

## Merge Multiple Group Policy Files Into One

If you have multiple `.POL` Group Policy files, you can quickly and accurately merge them into a single `.POL` file. The result will not have any duplicate policies in it. Select one main `.POL` file and then select other `.POL` files you want to merged with the main one. If 2 or more items with the same `KeyName` and `ValueName` exist, the ones from the `other` files will take precedence and overwrite the ones in the main file. This way you can consolidate your group policies without losing any important settings. This logic closely follows other merging strategies used in tools such as `LGPO.exe`.

## Convert Group Policy Files To JSON

You can convert your `.POL` files into JSON format. The Harden System Security app defines a JSON schema that preserves all of the policy details during conversion. You can reuse and import the same JSON files later in the app.

## Convert JSON Files To Group Policy Files

You can convert the JSON files created by the Harden System Security app back to `.POL` files in a lossless manner.

## Convert Security INF Files To JSON

Security INF files generated by the `Secedit` tool can be converted to JSON file format defined by the Harden System Security app. Please keep in mind that only the `[Registry Values]` section of the INF files are converted to JSON at the moment.

## Retrieve System Security Policy

Use this feature to create a very comprehensive security and policy report of the system and export them to a file. The report contains all of the security policies normally generated by `Secedit`, plus additional information about the current system.
