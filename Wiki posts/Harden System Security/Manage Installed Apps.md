In this page, you are able to retrieve the complete list of installed applications on the system along with their full details, including version numbers, installation dates, installation paths and more. You can uninstall any app(s) you don't want to be on your system. If the app(s) you selected are uninstallable then [the Harden System Security](https://github.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/wiki/Harden-System-Security) will try to uninstall them for all users first and if that fails then it will uninstall them for the current user only. The actions it takes are logged in the Logs page for you to review. Use the search bar to easily find the app(s) you are looking for.
