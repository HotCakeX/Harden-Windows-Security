<img src="https://github.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/raw/main/images/Gifs/Shiny.gif" width="27" alt="Features Item"> The module primarily uses Group policies, **the Microsoft recommended way of configuring Windows**. It also uses PowerShell cmdlets where Group Policies aren't available, and finally uses [a few registry keys](https://github.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/blob/main/Payload/Registry.csv) to configure security measures that can neither be configured using Group Policies nor PowerShell cmdlets. This is why the module doesn't break anything or cause unwanted behavior.

> [!WARNING]\
> **Any other 3rd party tool/program/script that claims to modify Windows or harden it, if they don't strictly adhere to the official rules above, they can damage your system, cause unknown problems and bugs.** [How are Group Policies for this module created and maintained?](https://github.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/wiki/Group-Policy#how-are-group-policies-for-the-module-created-and-maintained)

<img src="https://github.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/raw/main/images/Gifs/Shiny.gif" width="27" alt="Features Item"> When a hardening measure is no longer necessary because it's applied by default by Microsoft on new builds of Windows, it will also be removed from the module in order to prevent any problems and because it won't be necessary anymore.

<img src="https://github.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/raw/main/images/Gifs/Shiny.gif" width="27" alt="Features Item"> The module can be run infinite number of times, it's made in a way that it won't make any duplicate changes.

<img src="https://github.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/raw/main/images/Gifs/Shiny.gif" width="27" alt="Features Item"> The module prompts for confirmation before running each hardening category. Individual hardening measures with <img src="https://github.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/raw/main/images/Gifs/200iq.gif" width="35" alt="Requires Additional Confirmation"> icon prompt for **additional confirmation** before running.

<img src="https://github.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/raw/main/images/Gifs/Shiny.gif" width="27" alt="Features Item"> Applying these hardening measures makes your PC compliant with Microsoft Security Baselines and Secured-core PC specifications (provided that you use modern hardware that supports the latest Windows security features) - [See what makes a Secured-core PC](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/oem-highly-secure#what-makes-a-secured-core-pc) - <a href="#device-guard">Check Device Guard category for more details.</a>
> [Secured-core](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/oem-highly-secure) – recommended for the most sensitive systems and industries like financial, healthcare, and government agencies.

<img src="https://github.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/raw/main/images/Gifs/Shiny.gif" width="27" alt="Features Item"> If you have multiple accounts on your device, you only need to apply the hardening measures 1 time with Admin privileges, that will make system-wide changes. Then you can ***optionally*** run the module, without Admin privileges, for each standard user to apply the [Non-Admin category](https://github.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security#non-admin-commands).

You need to be aware that this means actions like downloading and opening an unknown file **will** make Microsoft Defender send samples of it to the Cloud for more advanced analysis and it can take a maximum of 60 seconds (this module sets it to max) from the time you try to open that unknown file to the time when it will be opened (if deemed safe), so you will have to wait. All of these security measures are in place by default in Windows to some extent and happen automatically, but this module **maxes them out and sets them to the highest possible levels**.

    - Here is an example of the notification you will see in Windows 11 if that happens.

Smart App Control also helps to block potentially unwanted apps, which are apps that may cause your device to run slowly, display unexpected ads, offer extra software you didn't want, or do other things you don't expect.
    - Smart App Control is User-Mode (and enforces Kernel-Mode) [Windows Defender Application Control policy (WDAC)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/windows-defender-application-control-design-guide), **more info** [**in the Wiki**](https://github.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/wiki/Introduction). You can see its status in [System Information](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/view-your-system-info-a965a8f2-0773-1d65-472a-1e747c9ebe00) and enable it manually from Microsoft Defender app's GUI. It is very important for Windows and Windows Defender intelligence updates to be always up-to-date in order for Smart App Control to work properly as it relies on live intelligence and definition data from the cloud and other sources to make a Smart decision about programs and files it encounters.
    - Smart App Control uses [ISG (Intelligent Security Graph)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/use-windows-defender-application-control-with-intelligent-security-graph#how-does-wdac-work-with-the-isg). The ISG isn't a "list" of apps. Rather, it uses the same vast security intelligence and machine learning analytics that power Microsoft Defender SmartScreen and Microsoft Defender Antivirus to help classify applications as having "known good", "known bad", or "unknown" reputation. This cloud-based AI is based on trillions of signals collected from Windows endpoints and other data sources and processed every 24 hours. As a result, the decision from the cloud can change.
    - [Smart App Control](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/windows-defender-application-control#wdac-and-smart-app-control) can block a program entirely from running or only [some parts of it](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/smart-app-control-has-blocked-part-of-this-app-0729fff1-48bf-4b25-aa97-632fe55ccca2) in which case your app or program will continue working just fine most of the time. It's improved a lot since it was introduced, and it continues doing so. Consider turning it on after clean installing a new OS and fully updating it.

    - Smart App Control enforces the [Microsoft Recommended Driver Block rules](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/application-security/application-control/windows-defender-application-control/design/microsoft-recommended-driver-block-rules) and the [Microsoft Recommended Block Rules](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/application-security/application-control/windows-defender-application-control/design/applications-that-can-bypass-wdac)

It [helps protect your valuable data](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/controlled-folders) from malicious apps and threats, such as ransomware. Controlled folder access protects your data by checking apps against a list of known, trusted apps. Due to the recent wave of global ransomware attacks, it is important to use this feature to protect your valuables files, specially OneDrive folders.
    - If it blocks a program from accessing one of your folders it protects, and you absolutely trust that program, then you can add it to exclusion list using Microsoft Defender GUI or PowerShell. you can also query the list of allowed apps using PowerShell (commands below). with these commands, you can backup your personalized list of allowed apps, that are relevant to your system, and restore them in case you clean install your Windows.
    - <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/main/images/Gifs/roratinggem.gif" width="28" alt="Rotating pink gem denoting registry or cmdlet"> The module adds the root of the OneDrive folders of all user accounts present, to the protected folders list of Controlled Folder Access, to provide Ransomware protection for the entire OneDrive folder.

Configuring attack surface reduction rules in Windows can help!

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/main/images/Gifs/bluemark.gif" width="25" alt="Blue Check mark denoting Group Policy"> [Attack surface reduction rules](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/attack-surface-reduction-rules-reference?view=o365-worldwide) target certain software behaviors, such as:

* Launching executable files and scripts that attempt to download or run files
* Running obfuscated or otherwise suspicious scripts
* Performing behaviors that apps don't usually initiate during normal day-to-day work

Such software behaviors are sometimes seen in legitimate applications. However, these behaviors are often considered risky because they are commonly abused by attackers through malware. Attack surface reduction rules can constrain software-based risky behaviors and help keep your organization safe.

- <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/main/images/Gifs/roratinggem.gif" width="28" alt="Rotating pink gem denoting registry or cmdlet"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/main/images/Gifs/bluemark.gif" width="25" alt="Blue Check mark denoting Group Policy"> This module sets up and configures Bitlocker [using official documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/information-protection/bitlocker/bitlocker-group-policy-settings), with the most secure configuration and Military Grade encryption algorithm, **XTS-AES-256, TPM 2.0 and start-up PIN**, to protect the confidentiality and integrity of all information at rest and in use.

    - OS drive is automatically encrypted (if it isn't already) when you run this category and select a startup PIN. For every other non-OS drive, there will be prompts for confirmation before encrypting it. Removable flash drives are skipped. Non-OS drives will have Recovery Password and Auto-unlock methods for authentication once they are encrypted.

    - You will be asked to enter a Startup PIN when activating Bitlocker for the first time. Make sure it contains at least 10 characters (uppercase and lowercase letters, symbols, numbers, spaces) and it's not the same as your Windows Hello PIN.

    - Once you run this module for the first time, there will be a text file containing the 48-digit recovery password for each encrypted drive that will be saved in itself, with the names like `Drive C recovery password.txt`. It is **very important to keep it in a safe and reachable place, e.g., in OneDrive's Personal Vault which requires authentication to access. See [Here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/onedrive/personal-vault) and [Here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/protect-your-onedrive-files-in-personal-vault-6540ef37-e9bf-4121-a773-56f98dce78c4) for more info about OneDrive's Personal Vault**

    - TPM has [special anti-hammering logic](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/information-protection/tpm/tpm-fundamentals) which prevents malicious user from guessing the authorization data indefinitely. [Microsoft defines that maximum number of failed attempts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/dubaisec/tpm-lockout) in Windows is 32 and every single failed attempt is forgotten after 2 hours. This means that every continuous two hours of powered on (and successfully booted) operation without an event which increases the counter will cause the counter to decrease by 1. You can view all the details using this [PowerShell command](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/trustedplatformmodule/get-tpm): `Get-TPM`.

    - Check out <a href="#lock-screen">Lock Screen</a> category for more info about the recovery password and the 2nd anti-hammering mechanism.

    - To have even more security than what the module provides, you can utilize a [Startup key in addition to the other 3 key protectors](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/information-protection/bitlocker/bitlocker-countermeasures#pre-boot-authentication) (TPM, Startup PIN and Recovery password). with this method, part of the encryption key is stored on a USB flash drive, and a PIN is required to authenticate the user to the TPM. This configuration **provides multifactor authentication** so that if the USB key is lost or stolen, it can't be used for access to the drive, because the correct PIN is also required.

    - BitLocker will bring you a real security against the theft of your device if you strictly abide by the following basic rules:
        - As soon as you have finished working, either Hibernate or shut Windows down and allow for every shadow of information to disappear from RAM within 2 minutes. **This practice is recommended in High-Risk Environments.**

        - Do not mix 3rd party encryption software and tools with Bitlocker. Bitlocker creates a secure end-to-end encrypted ecosystem for your device and its peripherals, this secure ecosystem is backed by things such as software, Virtualization Technology, TPM 2.0 and UEFI firmware, Bitlocker protects your data and entire device against **real-life attacks and threats**. You can encrypt your external SSDs and flash drives with Bitlocker too.

The reason and logic behind it is:

    - A malicious user might install malware that looks like the standard sign-in dialog box for the Windows operating system and capture a user's password. The attacker can then sign into the compromised account with whatever level of user rights that user has.

Sign-in attempts include Windows password or Windows Hello authentication methods. This threshold means, if the specified maximum number of failed sign-in attempts is exceeded, the device will invalidate the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) protector and any other protector except the 48-digit recovery password, and then reboot. During Device Lockout mode, the computer or device only boots into the touch-enabled Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE) until an authorized user enters the recovery password to restore full access.
    - This module (<a href="#bitlocker-settings">in the Bitlocker category</a>) automatically saves the 48-digit recovery password of each drive in itself, the location of it will also be visible on the PowerShell console when you run it. It is **very important to keep it in a safe and reachable place, e.g. in OneDrive's Personal Vault which requires authentication to access.

**Most of the Device Guard and Virtualization-Based Security features are Automatically enabled by default** on capable and modern hardware, this module only checks their status and if needed, enables UEFI lock for them and also proceeds with enabling [**full Secured-Core PC requirements**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/business/windows-11-secured-core-computers). UEFI locked security measures are rooted in **Proof of Physical Presence**.

<br>

Windows updates are extremely important. They always should be installed as fast as possible to stay secure and if a reboot is required, it should be done immediately. Threat actors can weaponize publicly disclosed vulnerabilities [**the same day** their POC (Proof-Of-Concept) is released.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/04/18/nation-state-threat-actor-mint-sandstorm-refines-tradecraft-to-attack-high-value-targets/).

In Windows by default, devices will scan daily, automatically download and install any applicable updates at a time optimized to reduce interference with usage, and then automatically try to restart when the end user is away.

**The following policies the module configures make sure the default behavior explained above is tightly enforced.**

Due to security reasons, many policies cannot be used when you are signed into Edge browser using personal Microsoft account. This module does not use any of those policies. When those policies are applied, they are ignored by the browser and `edge://policy/` shows an error for them.

<br>

* You can view all of the policies being applied to your Edge browser by visiting this page: `edge://policy/`
* You can find all of the available internal Edge pages in here: `edge://about/`

### Notes about MDAG (Microsoft Defender Application Guard)

* When DNS over HTTPS is set by user in Edge settings, Microsoft Defender Application Guard ignores that and connects directly to the Internet without using any DoH configuration.

* If DNS over HTTPS is enforced on Edge by a Group Policy or registry, then MDAG fails to connect to the Internet and shows DNS errors.

* **When DNS over HTTPS settings are set OS wide in Windows settings, both normal Edge and MDAG use the OS DoH settings.** *(This is the behavior set by this module)*

  * Use my [WinSecureDNSMgr module](https://github.com/HotCakeX/WinSecureDNSMgr) to easily configure DNS over HTTPS in Windows

### How can you 100% trust this repository and know that nothing shady is going on?

This repository uses the simplest possible, yet effective, methods that make it very easy to verify:

- Change log history is present on GitHub. *(Despite some of my awkward documentation typos)*

- You can open the file in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)/[Visual Studio Code Web](https://vscode.dev/), and view the module files in a nice easy to read environment, it's well formatted and indented.

- Commits are verified either with my GPG key or SSH key and [Vigilant mode](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/displaying-verification-statuses-for-all-of-your-commits) is turned on in my GitHub account.

- You can fork this repository, verify it until that point in time, then verify any subsequent changes/updates I push to this repository, **at your own pace** (using `Sync fork` and `Compare` options on your fork), and if you are happy with the changes, allow it to be merged with your own copy/fork on your GitHub account.
- You can [learn PowerShell which is super easy](https://github.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/wiki/Basic-PowerShell-tricks-and-notes), multiplatform, and useful for the future, Microsoft Learn website teaches you everything, then you will understand everything in the module is safe, or you can ask someone that you trust and knows PowerShell to verify the module for you.

- The [Payload folder](https://github.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/tree/main/Payload) in this repository contains the files required to run this module:
    - [Registry.csv](https://github.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/blob/main/Payload/Registry.csv) includes registry data used by this module, viewable in plain text and easily verifiable.

    - [ProcessMitigations.csv](https://github.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/blob/main/Payload/ProcessMitigations.csv) includes process mitigations data used by this module, viewable in plain text and easily verifiable.
  
    - [EventViewerCustomViews.zip](https://github.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/blob/main/Payload/EventViewerCustomViews.zip) includes XML files, in plain text, easily readable and verifiable. The module downloads and copies them to `C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Event Viewer\Views` so that when you open [Windows Event Viewer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/host-integration-server/core/windows-event-viewer1), you will find custom views as explained in the <a href="#miscellaneous-configurations">Miscellaneous Configurations</a> category.
  
    - [Security-Baselines-X.zip](https://github.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/blob/main/Payload/Security-Baselines-X.zip) includes Group Policies that are used by this module to apply the security measures explained in this page.

* <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/main/images/Gifs/RedStar.gif" width="30" alt="Red Star denoting Security Recommendation"> Always download your operation system from [official Microsoft websites](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download). Right now, Windows 11 is the latest version of Windows, its ISO file can be downloaded from this [official Microsoft server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows11). One of the worst things you can do to your own security and privacy is downloading your OS, which is the root of all the active and passive security measures, from a 3rd party website claiming they have the official unmodified files. There are countless bad things that can happen as the result of it such as threat actors embedding malware or backdoors inside the customized OS, or pre-installing customized root CA certificates in your OS so that they can perform TLS termination and view all of your HTTPS and encrypted Internet data in plain clear text, **even if you use VPN.** Having a poisoned and compromised certificate store is the endgame for you, and *that's just the tip of the iceberg.*

* <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/main/images/Gifs/RedStar.gif" width="30" alt="Red Star denoting Security Recommendation"> Whenever you want to install a program or app, first use the [Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/apps) or <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli">Winget</a>, if the program or app you are looking for isn't available in there, then download it from its official website. *Somebody created a nice web interface for interacting with Winget CLI <a href="https://winstall.app/">here</a>.* Using Winget or Microsoft store provides many benefits:

    - Microsoft store UWP apps are secure in nature, digitally signed, in [MSIX format](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/msix/overview). That means, installing and uninstalling them is guaranteed and there won't be any leftovers after uninstalling.

    - Microsoft store has Win32 apps too, they are traditional `.exe` installers that we are all familiar with. The store has a library feature that makes it easy to find the apps you previously installed.

    - Both Microsoft and Winget check the hash of the files by default, if a program or file is tampered, they will warn you and block the installation, whereas when you manually download a program from a website, you will have to manually verify the file hash with the hash shown on the website, if any.

* <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/main/images/Gifs/RedStar.gif" width="30" alt="Red Star denoting Security Recommendation"> If you live in a western country, NATO country, European country or Australia, do not use VPNs. **your local ISP (Internet service provider) is a lot more trustworthy than the remote VPN server's ISP.** Using VPN **only** takes the trust from your own local ISP and puts it in the hands of the remote ISP that the VPN server uses for its Internet, Nothing else. period. Do not fall for the fake advertisements of VPN companies, you never know who is behind the VPN provider, what their political views are, their background, where their allegiance lies. The permissive civilized western world could allow a state sponsor of terrorism or some other hostile country to create a VPN company in here and gather intelligence and collect bulk data for mining, tracking etc. this has happened before and one of [the most recent](https://www.techradar.com/news/iran-officials-linked-to-canada-based-free-vpn-provider) revelations is about a [VPN provider called Betternet, based in Canada](https://archive.ph/xOVeY), ran by [IRGC terrorists and their families abroad](https://twitter.com/lisa_loo_who/status/1567984903312257025). Stay vigilant and smart.

    - There are situations where using VPN can provide security and privacy. For example, when using a public WiFi hotspot or basically any network that you don't have control over. In such cases, use [Cloudflare WARP](https://cloudflarewarp.com/) which [uses WireGuard protocol](https://developers.cloudflare.com/warp-client/get-started/windows), *or as mentioned, use Secure Network in Edge browser that utilizes the same secure Cloudflare network*. It's free, it's from an American company that [has global radar](https://radar.cloudflare.com/) and lots of insight about countries in the world in real-time, [at least 19.7% of all websites use it (2022)](https://blog.cloudflare.com/application-security/). Safe to say it's one of the **backbones of the Internet.**

In your Microsoft account which has Outlook service, [you can create up to 10 Email aliases](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/add-or-remove-an-email-alias-in-outlook-com-459b1989-356d-40fa-a689-8f285b13f1f2) in addition to the 1 Email address you get when you made your Microsoft account, that means without creating a new account, you can have 11 Email addresses all of which will use the same inbox and account. You can specify which one of those Email aliases can be used to sign into your account, [in the sign in preferences of your Microsoft account settings](https://account.live.com/names/manage). So for example, when going passwordless, if you need you can give one of your Email aliases to others for communication or add it to a public profile of yours, then block sign in using that Email alias so nobody can send you authenticator notifications by entering that Email alias in the sign in page, and use the other 10 aliases that are private to sign into your Microsoft account with peace of mind. You can [create a rule in your Outlook](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/inbox-rules-in-outlook-web-app-edea3d17-00c9-434b-b9b7-26ee8d9f5622) so that all of the Emails sent to your public Email alias will be stored in a different folder, apart from your other inbox emails.

<br>

* <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/main/images/Gifs/RedStar.gif" width="30" alt="Red Star denoting Security Recommendation"> Use **NTFS** (which is the default Filesystem in Windows) or **ReFS** (Resilient File System, newer). In addition to all their benefits, they support `Mark Of The Web` (MOTW) or `zone.identifier`. When a file is downloaded to a device running Windows, Mark of the Web is added to the file, identifying its source as being from the internet. [You can read all the information about it in here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/deployoffice/security/internet-macros-blocked#mark-of-the-web-and-trusted-documents). If your USB flash drive is formatted as `FAT32`, change it to `NTFS`, because `FAT32` does not keep the `MOTW` of the files. If the file you are downloading is compressed in `.zip` format, make sure you open/extract it using Windows built-in support for `.zip` files because it keeps the MOTW of the files. If the compressed file you downloaded is in other formats such as `.7zip` or `.rar`, make sure you use an archive program that supports keeping the mark of the Web of files after extraction. One of those programs is NanaZip which is a fork of 7zip, available in [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9N8G7TSCL18R) and [GitHub](https://github.com/M2Team/NanaZip), compared to 7zip, it has better and modern GUI, and the application is [digitally signed](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/trusted-root/program-requirements). After installation, open it, navigate to `Tools` at the top then select `Options`, set `Propagate zone.id stream` to `Yes`. You can use this [PowerShell command](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/get-content?view=powershell-7.3#-stream) to find all the info about the Zone Identifier of the files you downloaded from the Internet.

```powershell

The latter is the most secure one since it will require authentication using Microsoft Authenticator app. `Ask for my PIN` is recommended for the most people because it will only require a PIN to be entered using controller.

<br>

* <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/main/images/Gifs/RedStar.gif" width="30" alt="Red Star denoting Security Recommendation"> A few reminders about open source programs:

    - Unless you are a skilled programmer who can understand and verify every line of code in the source, and spends time to personally build the software from the source, and repeats all the aforementioned tasks for each subsequent version, then seeing the source code won't have any effect on you because you aren't able to understand nor verify it.
  
    - **The majority of "open source" programs are unsigned,** meaning they don't have a digital signature, their developers haven't bought and used a code signing certificate to sign their program. Among other problems, this poses a danger to the end-users, makes it harder to create trust for those programs in security solutions and makes it hard to authenticate them. [Read Microsoft's Introduction to Code Signing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/internet-explorer/ie-developer/platform-apis/ms537361(v=vs.85)) or [Digicert's 5 reasons why Code Signing is necessary.](https://www.websecurity.digicert.com/security-topics/why-use-code-signing)
  
    - [When using "open source" program,](https://www.youtube.com/clip/Ugkxa5lOPIfLs67tGP0QzWRHOfqf3CSRaa2S) there is not the kind of liability that you've got when you consume software from a commercial entity that is obligated and knows their reputation is at risk/stake, that they have potential legal liability if there are vulnerabilities in their software. In the open-source world, there is a volunteer, consume it as is, and if there is a problem with the software, that's your responsibility.

* <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/main/images/Gifs/RedStar.gif" width="30" alt="Red Star denoting Security Recommendation"> Use Microsoft account (MSA) or Microsoft Entra ID to sign into Windows. Never use local administrators. Real security is achieved when there is no local administrator and identities are managed using Entra ID. You will be able to enforce [Multi-factor unlock](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/hello-for-business/feature-multifactor-unlock), for example use PIN + Fingerprint or PIN + Facial recognition, to unlock your device.
