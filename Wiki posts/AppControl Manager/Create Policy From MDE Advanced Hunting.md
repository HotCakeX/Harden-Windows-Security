Use this [AppControl Manager](https://github.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/wiki/AppControl-Manager) page to create App Control policies based on Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) Advanced Hunting exported CSV logs. [**Refer to this page for more information**](https://github.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/wiki/How-to-Use-Microsoft-Defender-for-Endpoint-Advanced-Hunting-With-WDAC-App-Control).

This page offers a data grid that has search functionality, sorting, removal of individual logs and copying entire rows or each cell to the clipboard.

You can also sign into your tenant to automatically retrieve Advanced Hunting logs related to Application Control and view, process, filter, search and convert them into App Control policies, all within the AppControl Manager application.

Performing Advanced Hunting queries requires `ThreatHunting.Read.All` [permission](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/security-security-runhuntingquery).
