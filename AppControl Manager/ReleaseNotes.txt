* You can now Show/Hide each column in the list views (aka data grids) in the app, making it easier to customize the view to your needs, hide columns you don't need and show only the ones you care about. By default, the columns related to Hash are hidden, if you want to display them, you simply have to click/tap on their corresponding option.

* Incremental loading list views found in Supplemental policy and Deny policy creation pages, now automatically enable resizable columns when the amount of the data about to be loaded exceeds 100k. This will instantly show the entire data in the list view and process the rest as you scroll, rather than processing the entire data at once which could cause delays in the UI.

* All of these improvements are made to make it much easier to scan the entire disk or multiple drives at once to create App Control policies. For instance, you can create an App Control policy for the entire C drive in ~2 minutes, depending on the hardware and the configured scalability setting in the app.

* Updated dependencies to the latest version.
