🎁✨ Merry Christmas! 🎄❄️

* Added creating, retrieving and removing Managed Installed policies for Intune. This has been a community request that is now complete: https://github.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/issues/976

   * Easily deploy a Managed Installer policy so apps deployed via Intune will be automatically allowed in your App Control policies.

* Updated dependencies to the latest versions.

* Made improvements to the performance of policy creations, especially when dealing with thousands of files.

* Fixed a bug/regression related to Policy Editor: When removing a file attribute from a policy, the references to that file attribute from the Signers that were referencing it were not being removed, which is fixed now in this update.

* Fixed an issue related to retrieving attributes of files during file scans: sometimes, the OriginalFileName or version of the files could not be retrieved successfully, it's been fixed in this update.

* In the Merge App Control Policies page, you can now right-click or tap + hold on the cards or browse buttons to view the files you've selected. They will also be highlighted when something has been selected.

* Added a refresh button to the "Validate App Control Policies" page so you can quickly re-validate after making changes to your policy without having to browse for it again. You can also right-click or tap + hold on the policy card to view the selected policy file with the option to clear it if you want.
