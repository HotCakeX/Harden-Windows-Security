✅ Removed 2 dependencies, "CommunityToolkit.WinUI.Behaviors" and "Microsoft.Xaml.Behaviors.WinUI.Managed". The result is reduced package size by ~150 KB for the app bundle and improved overall performance since the new codes are more targeted and optimized. This project always strives for leaner and more efficient codebases and less dependency usage.

✅ Fixed a visual issue in Remote Desktop sessions on hosts without a GPU where the new home page's stage background displayed in a too bright color, making the text hard to read.

✅ Added an extra check before applying/removing/verifying some of the security measures in the Microsoft Defender category related to the Defender antivirus, to make sure they have been initialized by the OS first.

✅ Improved the user experience: When an operation is in progress using the Apply All, Remove All, or Verify All buttons on a page, the other buttons are temporarily disabled until it completes. The active button remains enabled, allowing the operation to be canceled. Similarly, when the Apply, Remove, or Verify button of an individual security measure is running, all other buttons are disabled until it finishes. This change conveys the intended usage of the UI elements more clearly.
