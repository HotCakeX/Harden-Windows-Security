Use this page in the [Harden System Security App](https://github.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/wiki/Harden-System-Security) to retrieve every audit policy on the system. You can search, sort, and modify each policy's state individually.

You can **export** all Audit Policies from a system to a file after retrieving them. Additionally, you can **import** this file back into the app to automatically apply the same policies on another system. This allows you to create a custom Audit Policies template once and effortlessly **re-use it across multiple systems** using the Harden System Security app.
