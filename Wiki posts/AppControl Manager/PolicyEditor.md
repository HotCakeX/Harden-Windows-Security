Leverage the Policy Editor page to effortlessly refine your App Control policy files. With this tool, you can remove individual rules or clear all rules in one action, while accurately displaying the count of each rule type. Seamlessly search for the rule you wish to modify, and easily update policy details such as name, type, version, policy ID info, type ID, base policy ID, and HVCI option level.

Eliminate the need for error-prone, manual editing in a text editor. When you modify App Control policies with the Policy Editor, your policy remains fully compliant with the Code Integrity schema throughout the process.

This feature also deduplicates any redundant rules or signers within the policy file.

> [!TIP]\
> Please note that the IDs shown in the List Views do not correspond to the current IDs in the XML file. Instead, they represent the IDs that will be incorporated once you press the "Save the Changes" button.

<br>

> [!NOTE]\
> The Policy Editor organizes each rule for effortless adjustments. For instance, File Publisher or WHQL File Publisher rules are segmented into individual File Attributes. Removing all File Attributes at a specific level will automatically eliminate the associated Signer and any related elements, ensuring your App Control policy remains clean and precise. In essence, a WHQL File Publisher or File Publisher level without any File Attributes effectively reverts to a Publisher or WHQL Publisher.
