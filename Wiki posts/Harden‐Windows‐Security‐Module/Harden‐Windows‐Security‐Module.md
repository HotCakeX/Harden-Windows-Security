<br>

Harden Windows Security is a PowerShell module designed to simplify the application of critical security configurations in Windows. This tool offers a range of intuitive and innovative methods to enhance your system's security posture effortlessly. Detailed explanations of all available security measures can be found in the repository's README file. Harden Windows Security provides several modes of interaction to cater to different user preferences:

* Graphical User Interface (GUI): For those who prefer an interactive experience, a fully-featured GUI is available.

* Command-Line Interface (CLI): The complete feature set is accessible via the PowerShell command line for users who favor a script-based approach.

* Unattended Mode: Ideal for automation, this mode allows you to schedule and execute all or specific security configurations at predefined intervals.

* Executable Format: Thanks to its hybrid design, the same codebase, without any changes to it, can be compiled into an executable file, catering to users who prefer a standalone application.

Harden Windows Security also excels in rigorous compliance verification and security assessment. It empowers you to evaluate your system's adherence to security standards and recommendations outlined in this repository. The module is fully capable of conducting compliance checks and detecting policies applied through modern workplace management tools like Intune MDM, traditional Group Policies, Registry keys, Windows APIs, CIM, and more.

Furthermore, this module is invaluable for security researchers and penetration testers seeking to assess and improve their system's security posture. It is compatible with any system locale and language, ensuring broad usability.

## Comprehensive Logging Capabilities

Harden Windows Security includes detailed logging features that track every part of its operations. These logs are helpful for reviewing what actions were taken, making it easier to audit and troubleshoot. You can choose where these logs are saved:

* Log Files: Save logs in files for easy review and storage.

* Windows Event Logs: Add logs to Windows Event Viewer for centralized monitoring.

* Console Output: Display logs in the console for real-time updates.

These logging options ensure that all actions taken by Harden Windows Security are recorded, giving you clear visibility into your security processes. Whether youâ€™re conducting security checks, responding to issues, or just keeping an eye on things, these logs provide valuable information.

<br>

## Automatic Updates

The module checks for updates every time you run it and updates itself if there is a new version available, so you don't have to manually do anything.

## Protect-WindowsSecurity

## Syntax

```powershell
Protect-WindowsSecurity
    [-GUI]
    [-Categories <String[]>]
    [-Log]
    [-Offline]
    [<CommonParameters>]
```

## Description

The `Protect-WindowsSecurity` cmdlet's hybrid design allows it to operate with and without administrator privileges. You can use this cmdlet in both interactive and non-interactive modes.

In Interactive mode, the cmdlet will ask you to confirm the changes before applying them. In non-interactive mode, you can pre-configure the hardening categories you want to apply and the cmdlet will apply them without asking for confirmation.

> [!TIP]\
> It possesses the ability to operate entirely in isolation, useful for systems or servers that are disconnected from the Internet.

## Parameters

### -GUI

<br>

## Examples

### Example 1

If you run the module like this without specifying any categories, the module will run in interactive mode and the usual beautiful prompts will be displayed to the user.

```powershell
Protect-WindowsSecurity
```

### Example 2

This will display a GUI (Graphical UI) allowing you to easily select various options and categories to apply.

```powershell
Protect-WindowsSecurity -GUI
```

### Example 3

If you run the module like this, the 2 categories will be executed automatically without requiring any user input. The results will be displayed on the console.

```powershell
Protect-WindowsSecurity -Categories MicrosoftDefender, AttackSurfaceReductionRules
```

### Example 4

This example will apply the Microsoft Defender category with the Smart App Control sub-category, without the need for user interaction, and will show verbose messages.

```powershell
Protect-WindowsSecurity -Categories MicrosoftDefender -MSFTDefender_SAC -Verbose
```

### Example 5

This example will apply the Microsoft Security Baselines, BitLocker, User Account Control, Lock Screen and Downloads Defense Measures categories. It will also apply the "Only Elevate Signed and Validated Executables" sub-category of the User Account Control category, and the "Require CTRL + ALT + DEL on Lock Screen" sub-category of the Lock Screen category.

```powershell
Protect-WindowsSecurity -Categories MicrosoftSecurityBaselines,BitLockerSettings,UserAccountControl,LockScreen,DownloadsDefenseMeasures -UAC_OnlyElevateSigned -LockScreen_CtrlAltDel
```

### Example 6

This example instructs the cmdlet to run in offline mode and will not download any files from the internet. It also runs it in headless/silent mode by specifying which categories to automatically run. `-MSFTDefender_SAC` switch is used so the Smart App Control sub-category is also applied in the headless/silent mode. `-Log` switch is mentioned which will save the output of the cmdlet to a text file in the current working directory.

```powershell
Protect-WindowsSecurity -Verbose -Offline -PathToLGPO 'C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\LGPO.zip' -PathToMSFTSecurityBaselines 'C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\Baselines.zip' -PathToMSFT365AppsSecurityBaselines 'C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\M365Baselines.zip' -Log -Categories MicrosoftSecurityBaselines,MicrosoftDefender -MSFTDefender_SAC
```

## Syntax

```powershell
Confirm-SystemCompliance
    [-Categories]
    [-ExportToCSV]
    [-ShowAsObjectsOnly]
    [-DetailedDisplay]
    [-Offline]
```

## Description

This cmdlet verifies and validates all of the applied security measures described on the Readme page. Compliance checking strictly follows the guidelines and security measures of this GitHub repository. Any minor deviation from them will result in a `false` value for the corresponding check.

The policies can be applied via a wide variety of ways and they will all be detected:

* Intune
* CIM
* Registry keys
* Group Policies
* PowerShell cmdlets
* Windows APIs

> [!NOTE]\
> Based on the score that you get you will see a different ASCII art!

## Parameters

### -Categories

Specify the categories to check compliance for. If not specified, all categories will be checked.

## Technical Details

Harden Windows Security is a hybrid software solution built on the latest available .NET runtime. Approximately 99% of its codebase is written in C#, with PowerShell serving as the initial launch platform. Upon startup in PowerShell, control is quickly transferred to the C# code, and then returned to PowerShell upon completion. This approach leverages the .NET runtime DLLs that are included with PowerShell, eliminating the need for users to install the .NET runtime separately.

The repository includes a Visual Studio solution that allows you to build the software directly. If you decide to compile it, it's highly recommended to completely review the code first, then sign the binaries with your code-signing certificate for use as a standalone application in personal, business, or enterprise environments. While the code can be modified if needed, no changes are required for a successful compilation result in the latest version of Visual Studio.
