# Privacy Policy for the AppControl Manager

## Introduction

Thank you for using AppControl Manager ("the App"). This Privacy Policy outlines the data that is stored locally and/or collected while you interact with the App. By using the App, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

## 1. Information We Collect

The App stores user configurations in `C:\Program Files\AppControl Manager`. The User Configuration file is a JSON file that includes information such as the path to the XML files created by the app. User has full control over this process and can remove or replace the data at any time. No other kind of information is collected or stored.

## 2. Use of Your Data

AppControl Manager offers the ability to sign into your Microsoft tenant(s) for remote policy management, deployment as well as working with the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) Advanced Hunting data. As a result, it will receive authentication tokens from the browser you log into in order to make API requests to retrieve the data that you explicitly request. The App Adheres to the least privilege access principle. The authentication tokens are only stored securely in the App's memory and are automatically discarded when you sign out of the tenant inside of the app or exit the app, whichever of those events happens sooner. The App never stores any of such sensitive information on disk.

## 3. Third-Party Services

AppControl Manager does not integrate with any third-party services or tools that may collect or process your personal data. All of the services and features used by the AppControl Manager are 1st party from Microsoft and no data is ever collected or transmitted to the creator of the AppControl Manager. AppControl Manager does not use any 3rd party dependency either.

## 4. Security

We prioritize your privacy and security. AppControl Manager goes above and beyond to ensure user security through various means. Please [refer to this section of the AppControl Manager's documentation](https://github.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/wiki/AppControl-Manager#security) for technical information regarding security.

## 5. Updates to the Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page, with the updated date at the top. Please review this Privacy Policy periodically for any updates.
