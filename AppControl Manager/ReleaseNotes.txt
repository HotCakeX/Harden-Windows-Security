* Added optional per user encryption for Policies Library cache (off by default). Cached policy files are encrypted using Windows DPAPI for the current user only. The app enforces the encryption setting at startup and when the Sidebar toggle changes. Encrypted files are only accessible on the same Windows user account.

   * `Backup All` under the `Actions` menu creates unencrypted backups regardless of encryption setting, ensuring policies are accessible when restoring from backup on different accounts or machines.

   * Encryption Scope: User scope allows only the current Windows account to decrypt files. Machine scope restricts decryption to the device, preventing access if files are moved elsewhere.

   * If using Administrator Protection mode, Machine scope is recommended. Machine scope allows any user on the device to decrypt, while User scope restricts to the encrypting user only.

* Scan Levels now visually show fallback levels and their order, clarifying workflows based on community feedback.

* Improved overall performance during policy creation - less RAM and CPU usage for the same tasks.

* Added Home page tile showing total count of USB devices connected to your device. Click/tap to view detailed list of each device. Useful for forensic purposes.

* Added support for .BIN App Control policy files. Open in Policy Editor to decode or drag to Policies Library to import.
