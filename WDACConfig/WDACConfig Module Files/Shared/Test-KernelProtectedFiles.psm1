Function Test-KernelProtectedFiles {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Detects kernel-protected files files such as the main executable of the games installed through Xbox app inside of the event logs
    .DESCRIPTION
        For these files, only Kernel can get their details such as hashes, it passes them to event viewer and we take them from event viewer logs
        Any other attempts such as "Get-FileHash" or "Get-AuthenticodeSignature" fails and ConfigCI Module cmdlets totally ignore these files and do not create allow rules for them
