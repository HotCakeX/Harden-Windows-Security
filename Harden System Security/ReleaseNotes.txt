✅ Updated the dependencies to the latest versions, including major ones such as .NET SDK and Windows App SDK.

✅ Added icons to more areas that didn't have one, helping with discoverability and usability.

✅ Activated additional thorough analyzers for the Harden System Security app, enabling early detection of more possible issues during compilation.

✅ Aligned the update availability experience in the Harden System Security app with the one in AppControl Manager. Now, when an update is available, you'll see a small icon on the lower left corner on the Update page's icon, informing you that there is a new version available. As a reminder, you can turn off auto-update check in the Update page by simply toggling a button.

✅ Improved the design of UI elements that show the total count of items in each list view. They now have a more sophisticated and consistent design across the entire app and show the count of the data instantly without any delay, so if there was even a few milliseconds delay before, it's not there anymore.
