# Sidebar

The [AppControl Manager](https://github.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/wiki/AppControl-Manager) features a versatile Sidebar designed to streamline user interactions and enhance productivity. With the Sidebar, you can select a base policy path once and seamlessly reuse it throughout the app, eliminating the need to repeatedly browse for the file.

Pages within AppControl Manager that require an XML policy file automatically recognize when a path has been selected in the Sidebar. As you navigate to these pages, subtle indicators appear, prompting you to open the Sidebar and quickly access the pre-selected file path.

The Sidebar also includes a toggle switch that, when enabled, automatically assigns newly created base policy paths to the Sidebar. This feature further accelerates workflow and minimizes manual input.

By default, the Sidebar displays the XML policy path specified in the App settings, ensuring immediate access to the main policy you work with.
