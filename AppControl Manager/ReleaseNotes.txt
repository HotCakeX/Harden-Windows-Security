✅ Updated the dependencies to the latest versions, including major ones such as .NET SDK and Windows App SDK.

✅ Improved scrolling performance in list views with large data sets by utilizing phased loads based on the importance of each column's data type.

✅ Added icons to many buttons and other areas that didn't have one, helping with discoverability and usability.

✅ The Font Families list in the Settings page is now sorted alphabetically, making it easier to find the font name you're looking for.

✅ Improved localization.

✅ The Get Code Integrity Hashes page now supports dragging files onto it and dropping them there to calculate their hashes. (Available only when the app running unelevated)

✅ In the Simulation page, replaced the "Save output to CSV" option with "Export to JSON". JSON is a more structured format and exporting to JSON is a lot faster due to source generated serializers. This also aligns with other export options in the app because they all use JSON as the output format.

✅ Whenever you select an item by browsing for it, the button responsible for it will have a distinct shadow around it and its text will be changed to "Selected" (localized), indicating that you've selected that item. Completes this feature request. As a reminder, you can always review the items you've selected and clear your selections by right-clicking or tap + holding on the button.
