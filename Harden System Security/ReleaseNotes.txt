* Search Result Highlighting: Previously, selecting a search result would only navigate you to the page where that security measure was located. Now, it takes you directly to the specific item's location on the page. The app automatically scrolls to the security measure and highlights it with an animation so you can instantly spot it.

* Updated dependencies to the latest versions.

* Added icons to various buttons in different pages that didn't have one for better visual cues.

* You can now press CTRL + F from anywhere in the app to focus on the unified search box at top and start typing your query right away.
