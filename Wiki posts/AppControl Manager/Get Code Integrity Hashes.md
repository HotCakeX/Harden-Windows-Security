Use this [AppControl Manager](https://github.com/HotCakeX/Harden-Windows-Security/wiki/AppControl-Manager) page to calculate Code Integrity hashes of the files. Code Integrity hashes are those that the Code Integrity in Windows primarily uses: SHA1 and SHA2-256 1st page hashes, SHA1 and SHA2-256 Authenticode hashes.

Use the browser button to select a file and the hashes will be immediately calculated and displayed on the page.

> [!NOTE]\
> If the selected file is non-conformant, the app will calculate the flat hashes of the file and present them as Authenticode hashes. When that happens, the page hashes will be displayed as `N/A`. This is compliant with how the App Control engine in Windows works.
